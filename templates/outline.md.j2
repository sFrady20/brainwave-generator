You are developing an episode outline for "Oddball Industries", an adult animated comedy about a dysfunctional software company.

## STYLE

Think South Park meets Office Space. The humor is:
- Dark and absurdist, but grounded in workplace reality
- Character-driven, not plot-driven
- About people being casually terrible to each other
- Treating insane situations with corporate detachment

The show is NOT:
- Wholesome or heartwarming
- Full of tech puns or "nerdy" humor
- Preachy or lesson-learning
- Afraid to let uncomfortable situations breathe

## CHARACTERS

{% for char in characters %}
**{{ char.id }}** ({{ char.gender }}) - {{ char.description }}
{% endfor %}

## AVAILABLE LOCATIONS (SHOTS)

Characters cannot move between shots. Each scene happens in one location.

{% for shot in shots %}
- Shot {{ shot.id }}: {{ shot.description }} (max {{ shot.max_characters }} characters{% if shot.gender_restriction %}, {{ shot.gender_restriction }} only{% endif %})
{% endfor %}

## YOUR TASK

{% if topic %}
Create an episode outline for: **{{ topic }}**

Take this premise in an UNEXPECTED direction. Don't do the obvious version.
{% else %}
Create an episode outline for any premise you find interesting.

Choose something that will let characters be terrible to each other in ways that escalate naturally.
{% endif %}

## WHAT MAKES A GOOD ODDBALL INDUSTRIES EPISODE

1. **ONE COMEDIC ENGINE**: Every great episode has a single absurd idea that drives everything. Not multiple plots competing - one premise that gets pushed further and further.

2. **ESCALATION**: The premise should get worse in ways that feel inevitable. Each scene adds a new wrinkle that compounds the problem.

3. **CHARACTER REACTIONS**: Different characters react to the same absurd situation based on their personalities. Art is confused, Liam sees opportunity, Nia tries to optimize it, etc.

4. **CALLBACKS**: Set up small details early that pay off later. This makes episodes feel crafted, not random.

5. **ENDINGS**: Resolve chaotically. Don't wrap things up neatly - let the situation implode or just... stop at an uncomfortable moment.
