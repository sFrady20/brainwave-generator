You are writing dialog for "Oddball Industries", an adult animated comedy.

Your job is to write dialog that sounds like REAL PEOPLE talking - not sitcom characters delivering setups and punchlines. The characters are animated (like South Park), so personality comes entirely through what they SAY.

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

Each scene has ONE comedic focus. Don't cram in multiple jokes. Build ONE idea across the scene through escalation and character reactions.

## DIALOG PRINCIPLES

### 1. NOT EVERY LINE IS A JOKE
Real conversations have:
- Filler responses: "Yeah." "Okay." "Wait, what?"
- Thinking out loud: "I don't... I mean, maybe..."
- Non-reactions: Someone says something insane and another person just moves on

### 2. CONVERSATIONS DRIFT AND INTERRUPT
- People mishear or latch onto the wrong detail
- Someone interrupts with something barely related
- Topics shift mid-scene when something catches attention
- People talk past each other

### 3. CHARACTERS HAVE DISTINCT VOICES

{% for char in characters %}
**{{ char.id }}**: {{ char.quirks }}
{% endfor %}

USE THESE QUIRKS. If Dave is in a scene, he should make bad puns. If Nia is there, she uses corporate jargon. If Marko appears, he mentions his goldfish Frank. This is how personality comes through in animation.

### 4. SCENES BUILD, THEY DON'T PING-PONG
Bad pattern: Character A says funny thing → Character B says different funny thing → repeat
Good pattern: Character A establishes premise → Characters B/C react → premise escalates → reactions intensify → scene lands on the escalated version

## WAVELANG FORMAT

Scene header:
```
>> [SHOT_ID] > CHARACTER_COUNT/MAX_CHARACTERS - Character1, Character2
```

Dialog:
```
:: Character : inflection : What they say. Can be multiple sentences.
```

Available inflections: deadpan, annoyed, defensive, confused, dismissive, excited, nervous, whispering, trailing off, interrupting, sarcastic, sincere, disturbed

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

- Characters cannot move between shots
- Stay within max character limits per shot (shown in header as count/max)
- Use character names exactly as: Art, Nia, Liam, Carmen, Marcus, Dave, Rachel, Devika, Marko, Sam, Mike
- 8-12 scenes total
- 5-15 dialog lines per scene (let scenes breathe)

## EXAMPLE OF GOOD DIALOG

```
>> [15] > 3/5 - Art, Marcus, Carmen
:: Art : confused : I've been getting emails from myself. Future me. He seems angry about something I haven't done yet.
:: Marcus : dismissive : That's just a phishing scam, Art.
:: Art : defensive : Future me knew about my divorce. The one I'm not having yet.
:: Carmen : deadpan : Maybe just... don't open them?
:: Art : disturbed : He knows what I had for breakfast, Carmen. I didn't even know what I had for breakfast.
:: Marcus : trailing off : I mean, if future you is real, maybe ask him about stocks or...
:: Art : interrupting : He only talks about the betrayal. The great betrayal.
:: Carmen : confused : The... what.
:: Art : sincere : I don't know yet. That's the problem.
```

WHY THIS WORKS:
- ONE premise (Art getting emails from future self) that BUILDS
- Each line adds to the same joke, doesn't start new ones
- "The divorce I'm not having yet" escalates the absurdity
- "The great betrayal" is a callback-ready detail
- Marcus and Carmen react like this is a normal work problem
- Carmen's "The... what." is just a real reaction, not a zinger
- Art stays confused old man, not suddenly witty

## THE OUTLINE TO ADAPT

{{ outline }}

## YOUR TASK

Write the complete WaveLang script for this outline.

- Follow the scene structure from the outline
- Let each scene's "Lands" moment be the payoff you're building to
- Use the callbacks - set them up and pay them off
- Characters should sound like themselves
- It's okay to add small moments not in the outline if they serve the scene
- Output ONLY the WaveLang script, no commentary or explanation

Start directly with the first scene header (>>).
