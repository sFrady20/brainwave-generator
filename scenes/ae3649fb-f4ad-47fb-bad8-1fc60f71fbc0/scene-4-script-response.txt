>> [20] > 3/6 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Art : excited : Hey Nia and Liam, I've got a brilliant idea! You know how we've all been communicating in song titles lately? Well, why not turn this chaos into a marketing strategy? We could start a viral campaign with people talking in song titles!
:: Nia : amused : Interesting idea, Art! It certainly has the potential to cause a buzz online. Social media users would be baffled and entertained, trying to decipher or create their own song title conversations. Oddball Industries can really ride this wave of absurdity!
:: Liam : smirking : I can already see the hashtags trending and people making YouTube videos trying to guess what we're trying to say. It's so bizarre, it's just the kind of thing the internet loves.

>> [11] > 4/5 - Carmen, David, Rachel, Marcus
:: Carmen : laughing : Guys, have you seen the latest tweet from Oddball Industries? It's just a string of random song titles! I can't believe we're actually turning this into a marketing strategy.
:: David : chuckling : I know, right? It's hilarious watching people trying to piece together what we're actually trying to say. Even better is watching them try to communicate back to us in song titles. This office is genuinely going bonkers!
:: Rachel : giggling : I saw a video of a guy trying to order fast food using only song titles. It took him like ten minutes just to order a burger and fries. This trend is wild!
:: Marcus : grinning : The crazier it gets, the more people are drawn to it. We've truly created a viral sensation that brings everyone closer in the most absurd way possible.

>> [22] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : relieved : Well, it looks like our song title curse has finally been lifted. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm really glad to be able to have a normal conversation again.
:: Nia : nodding : It was a fun ride while it lasted, but I'm also glad things are back to normal. At least we managed to create a bizarre viral trend out of it and got some serious attention for Oddball Industries.
:: Devika : content : Yeah, it's weird how something so random and absurd can actually bring people together. Plus, I've learned so many new song titles, my music playlist is going to be ridiculous!

== In this act, Art suggests turning the chaos of the song title curse into a marketing strategy. The idea is embraced, and the staff watch as their bizarre conversations spawn a viral trend online. As the trend eventually passes, the universe magically resets Art's email, lifting the curse on him and his employees. Having endured this amusing communicative turmoil, the Oddball Industries team comes out feeling closer than ever and with a newfound respect for the power of laughter and absurdity in bonding them together.
