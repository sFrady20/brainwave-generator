>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Liam
:: Liam : chuckling : Art, buddy, this "song title talk" has got us all in stitches! But seriously, we need to get some actual work done. How about we try and discuss our sales strategy using the worst pop song titles ever? Think we're up for the challenge?
:: Art : bemused : My "Achy Breaky Heart" tells me we might just "Hit Me Baby One More Time" with this strategy, and we'll be "Livin' La Vida Loca"! So, Liam, let's "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" on this pop song title rollercoaster!
:: Liam : laughing : Alright Art, you got it! So, for starters, we need to "Get the Party Started" with our marketing campaign. It's time to "Spice Up Your Life" with some new ideas!

>> [12] > 1/2 - Marcus
:: Marcus : amused : Oh, the sheer joy of these song title conversations. I can't wait to see how the meeting with Art and Liam unfolds. They'll probably "Blame It on the Boogie" when nothing gets done today.

>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Devika, Carmen
:: David : snickering : Have you guys heard about Art and his song title communication? It's absolute madness! I can't hold back my laughter every time I hear him talk!
:: Devika : giggling : I know, right? It's like we're all living in some bizarre musical! So, David, as part of the software team, how do we "Pump Up the Jam" with our new features?
:: Carmen : grinning : Oh, I've got a suggestion! Let's "Wannabe" the best in the market by incorporating user-friendly designs, you know, really "Spice Up" our software!
:: Devika : laughing : Perfect! Let's bring our A-game and "Fight for our Right to Party" with the competition!

>> [18] > 2/3 - Rachel, Marcus
:: Rachel : smirking : Marcus, all this song title talk has the office buzzing! I never thought I'd hear management discussing strategies through pop songs!
:: Marcus : cheerfully : Well, Rachel, sometimes we need a little "Rhythm of the Night" to break up the monotony of office life. Just make sure you "Don't Stop Believin'" in our team's potential!

== In this act, the office continues to embrace the song title communication craze started by Art. David, Devika, and Carmen engage in a conversation using song titles, trying to discuss software improvements in a fun and whimsical manner. The sheer absurdity and humor of the situation has everyone laughing and gossiping as they try to understand what's happening. The work environment has become even more chaotic and entertaining, with employees bonding over the ridiculousness of using song titles to communicate.
