>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Rachel
:: Art : puzzled : "Born to Run"? What's going on with my brain today?
:: Rachel : confused : Um, Art, are you feeling alright? You seem a bit... off.
:: Art : frustrated : "Help!" Cannot seem to express myself today, Rachel!
>> [13] > 2/3 - Carmen, David
:: Carmen : laughing : David, rumor has it Art's speaking in nothing but song titles! 
:: David : amused : Really? That's "Another One Bites the Dust" for Art's sanity!
:: Carmen : giggling : I know, right? It's so absurd, I can't stop laughing!
>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Art
:: Art : desperate : "Can't Get No Satisfaction!" 
:: Marcus : trying to hold back his laughter : Art, my dear friend, your communication is nothing but a "Bridge Over Troubled Water" right now. Are you going through some kind of "Purple Haze" era?
>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Liam
:: Liam : smirking : Art, buddy, I heard you're having a rough day in "Hotel California."
:: Art : sad : "I Want to Break Free" from this curse!
:: Liam : joking : Well, Art, better buckle up, because "We Will Rock You" with these song titles!
>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Art, Rachel
:: Nia : concerned : Art, I don't know what's going on, but if this keeps up, we'll be "Living on a Prayer" in terms of our productivity.
:: Art : frustrated : "Don't Stop Believin'" in me, Nia!
:: Rachel : laughing : This is just too good! I mean, I feel bad for you Art, but at the same time, you're a walking internet meme right now!
>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Liam
:: Liam : chuckling : Art, buddy, this "song title talk" has got us all in stitches! But seriously, we need to get some actual work done. How about we try and discuss our sales strategy using the worst pop song titles ever? Think we're up for the challenge?
:: Art : bemused : My "Achy Breaky Heart" tells me we might just "Hit Me Baby One More Time" with this strategy, and we'll be "Livin' La Vida Loca"! So, Liam, let's "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" on this pop song title rollercoaster!
:: Liam : laughing : Alright Art, you got it! So, for starters, we need to "Get the Party Started" with our marketing campaign. It's time to "Spice Up Your Life" with some new ideas!
>> [12] > 1/2 - Marcus
:: Marcus : amused : Oh, the sheer joy of these song title conversations. I can't wait to see how the meeting with Art and Liam unfolds. They'll probably "Blame It on the Boogie" when nothing gets done today.
>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Devika, Carmen
:: David : snickering : Have you guys heard about Art and his song title communication? It's absolute madness! I can't hold back my laughter every time I hear him talk!
:: Devika : giggling : I know, right? It's like we're all living in some bizarre musical! So, David, as part of the software team, how do we "Pump Up the Jam" with our new features?
:: Carmen : grinning : Oh, I've got a suggestion! Let's "Wannabe" the best in the market by incorporating user-friendly designs, you know, really "Spice Up" our software!
:: Devika : laughing : Perfect! Let's bring our A-game and "Fight for our Right to Party" with the competition!
>> [18] > 2/3 - Rachel, Marcus
:: Rachel : smirking : Marcus, all this song title talk has the office buzzing! I never thought I'd hear management discussing strategies through pop songs!
:: Marcus : cheerfully : Well, Rachel, sometimes we need a little "Rhythm of the Night" to break up the monotony of office life. Just make sure you "Don't Stop Believin'" in our team's potential!
>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Carmen, Rachel
:: Art : excited : Hey everybody! Come on in for a meeting, we're going to try something new. It's time to rock out to bring some clarity to this communication debacle!
:: Carmen : amused : Alright, I'm down for this! What do we have to lose, right? This day couldn't get any more absurdly entertaining.
:: Rachel : curious : I'm game! Let's turn these song titles into an epic conference performance.
>> [20] > 6/6 - Art, David, Carmen, Rachel, Marcus, Devika
:: Art : enthusiastic : Alright folks, let's gather around the pool table, grab a microphone, and unleash a symphony of song titles to express our thoughts!
:: David : chuckling : This is going to be a spectacle! Never imagined a company meeting turning into a hilarious musical number!
:: Marcus : laughing : Ah, yes! A "Total Eclipse of the Heart" and "Stairway to Heaven" all in one place! Let the chaotic melody commence.
:: Carmen : smirking : I bet our "Thriller" moves will make us "Dancing Queens" in no time. Let's get this party started!
:: Rachel : grinning : In the spirit of "Bohemian Rhapsody," I guess this is the real life or just fantasy? Who knows anymore!
:: Devika : rolling_eyes : Fine, I'm in. After all, being "Under Pressure" has never been this hilariously absurd.
>> [11] > 5/5 - Nia, Liam, Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Nia : chuckling : I can't believe this is happening. I can't wait to "Walk the Line" of sanity at this extravagant song title banquet.
:: Liam : smirking : If we're going to be "Living on a Prayer," might as well make it an unforgettable one!
:: Marcus : laughing : A "Sweet Child O' Mine," this sure will be a day to remember!
:: David : grinning : As they say, "Every Rose Has Its Thorn," but I'm ready to embrace the chaos!
:: Carmen : smiling : Let's "Shake It Off" and make the most of this wild ride! Also, I think we just set a world record for song title references in a single conversation.
>> [18] > 3/3 - Art, David, Rachel
:: Art : chuckling : You know, David, after that epic rock-out session, I can't help but wonder if we've unlocked some sort of office logic through song titles. It's like we're speaking a whole new language!
:: David : smirking : Art, I gotta say, I never thought I'd see the day when we'd be singing along like crazed karaoke fans. But as they say, "You can't always get what you want," right? Or can you...in song titles?
:: Rachel : laughing : This whole situation reminds me of that saying, "When words fail, music speaks." It's like we're finally understanding each other on a deeper level, even if it's just through song titles.
>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Samantha
:: Nia : amused : I've got to admit, Sam, I didn't think I'd ever be laughing this hard at work. But something about these song title conversations has me loosening up a bit. It's almost...refreshing.
:: Samantha : smirking : I know what you mean, Nia. I never thought I'd find myself cracking up over water-cooler jokes, but here we are. I guess there's a method to this mad musical madness after all!
>> [11] > 5/5 - Marcus, Devika, Liam, Carmen, Marko
:: Marcus : excited : You know, as bonkers as this all is, I can't help but feel like we've stumbled onto something fantastic. People have been laughing all day, and the office has this incredible energy!
:: Devika : grinning : I've got to agree with Marcus, this is one of the most fun days we've had around here in a long time! It's like everyone's finally letting loose and embracing their inner goofball.
:: Liam : laughing : And who would have thought it would take a viral chain-email to make it happen? I mean, we're discussing high-stakes meetings in the form of pop song titles, and no one's even mad about it!
:: Carmen : agreeing : It's wild, right? Today's proven that even in the most serious situations, a little laughter can go a long way in bringing people together. I never expected to see this side of ourselves!
:: Marko : chuckling : Yeah, it's amazing how a bit of silliness can completely change the atmosphere in the office. I feel like I've learned something new about everyone today, and we got a good laugh out of it too.
>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Devika, Rachel
:: David : optimistic : I know this might sound cheesy, but I think all this song title madness has taught us a valuable lesson. Even in the face of adversity, laughter really is the best medicine.
:: Devika : thoughtful : You're right, David. Sometimes, we don't need to take ourselves so seriously. We can find humor in the most unexpected places, and it's those moments that remind us how important it is to have a good laugh.
:: Rachel : beaming : I completely agree! Today has been a whirlwind of absurdity, but it's brought us all closer together. I feel like we've bonded over something so uniquely Oddball Industries-esque. It's absolutely unforgettable!
>> [20] > 3/6 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Art : excited : Hey Nia and Liam, I've got a brilliant idea! You know how we've all been communicating in song titles lately? Well, why not turn this chaos into a marketing strategy? We could start a viral campaign with people talking in song titles!
:: Nia : amused : Interesting idea, Art! It certainly has the potential to cause a buzz online. Social media users would be baffled and entertained, trying to decipher or create their own song title conversations. Oddball Industries can really ride this wave of absurdity!
:: Liam : smirking : I can already see the hashtags trending and people making YouTube videos trying to guess what we're trying to say. It's so bizarre, it's just the kind of thing the internet loves.
>> [11] > 4/5 - Carmen, David, Rachel, Marcus
:: Carmen : laughing : Guys, have you seen the latest tweet from Oddball Industries? It's just a string of random song titles! I can't believe we're actually turning this into a marketing strategy.
:: David : chuckling : I know, right? It's hilarious watching people trying to piece together what we're actually trying to say. Even better is watching them try to communicate back to us in song titles. This office is genuinely going bonkers!
:: Rachel : giggling : I saw a video of a guy trying to order fast food using only song titles. It took him like ten minutes just to order a burger and fries. This trend is wild!
:: Marcus : grinning : The crazier it gets, the more people are drawn to it. We've truly created a viral sensation that brings everyone closer in the most absurd way possible.
>> [22] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : relieved : Well, it looks like our song title curse has finally been lifted. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm really glad to be able to have a normal conversation again.
:: Nia : nodding : It was a fun ride while it lasted, but I'm also glad things are back to normal. At least we managed to create a bizarre viral trend out of it and got some serious attention for Oddball Industries.
:: Devika : content : Yeah, it's weird how something so random and absurd can actually bring people together. Plus, I've learned so many new song titles, my music playlist is going to be ridiculous!
