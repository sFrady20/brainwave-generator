>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, David
:: Art : groggy : David! I just had the most bizarre experience, and I need someone to believe me. I was taking a power nap and suddenly, I found myself aboard an alien spacecraft!
:: David : clumsy : Oh! Art, that sounds, um, out-of-this-world! *knocks over a cup of pens* Oops... Uh, anyway, tell me more about this alien encounter.

:: Art : enthusiastic : It was incredible, David! These extraterrestrial beings shared their unworldly wisdom with me, and now I feel like I have some grand cosmic knowledge. You, of all people, would appreciate such an oddball experience.
:: David : grinning : That's one giant leap for boss-kind! *trips over a chair* Ha, well, Art, I can't say I've ever had anything quite like that happen to me, but I'm all ears for the little green men's enlightenment!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Rachel, Carmen, Marko
:: Art : excited : Gather round, my friends! I've just had a life-altering experience. I was abducted by aliens who bestowed their cosmic wisdom upon me!
:: Rachel : sceptical : Oh, Art, the only thing that's been abducted is your sense of reality. Are you sure it wasn't just an oddly specific dream?
:: Carmen : amused : I dunno, Rachel - maybe the aliens gave him the secret to punctuality too! *laughs* Just kidding, Art. But seriously, this is too good not to share. What did they tell you?
:: Marko : intrigued : Yeah, Art, tell us all about your little green mates from outer space. Maybe they could help me finish this design project on time!

:: Art : adamantly : I know it sounds crazy, but I assure you, it felt so real. They told me the secrets of the universe and showed me things I could never have imagined! I can't explain it, but I feel different now.
:: Rachel : humoring : Well, Art, if you believe it was real, then who are we to doubt your amazing alien adventure? Maybe you could use your newfound alien wisdom to boost our quarterly profits!
:: Carmen : teasing : Or teach us the secret alien handshake! *laughs* But really, Art, you've always been a bit... otherworldly anyway. This just takes it to a whole new level!
:: Marko : chuckling : It's true, Art. You've always been our very own space cowboy. We'll just have to see if this extraterrestrial knowledge helps you hit warp speed with company success!

== In this act, Art wakes up from a power nap convinced that he's experienced an actual abduction by aliens and has been given unworldly wisdom. He excitedly shares his experience with David, who, despite his clumsy ways, inadvertently encourages Art. Art then gathers a group of employees, including Rachel, Carmen, and Marko, to share his experience and discuss the newfound knowledge. The conversation is filled with playful banter, jokes, and off-topic discussions, showcasing each character's unique personality while building up the plot.
