title: Art's Alien Abduction
exposition: Art wakes up after a power nap, convinced that he experienced an actual abduction by aliens who imparted unworldly wisdom to him. Unsure of who to believe him, Art first approaches David, who inadvertently encourages him with his clumsy clumsiness.

rising action: Art gathers several employees, including Rachel, Carmen, and Marko, discussing his newfound knowledge and creating a buzz throughout the office. As word spreads, Liam jumps in with his exaggerations, only making the situation more bizarre. Soon enough, conspiracy theories and lively debates are sparking at every corner of the office.

climax: At the peak of the madness, Nia, the voice of reason, holds a presentation on debunking alien abduction stories that only fans the flames of Art's obsession. This leads to chaos and disruptions all around, driving some near the brink of total absurdity.

falling action: Desperate to settle the ongoing inability to see his vision, Art turns to Devika and Marcus for help quelling rumors and crafting the ultimate counter-argument to regain credibility. Leveraging creative design work mixed with their quick wit, they create a hilariously unconvincing dramatization of Art's alleged abduction.

resolution: Accepting that his abduction experience may not hold up to literal intervention but fawning in the humore created throughout Oddball Industies, Art diffuses the hysteria leading Oddball Industries employees to return to their everyday office antics. Despite his best efforts to maintain an alleged supernatural experience, the characters ultimately come together to release tension through acceptance and their own absurd humor exaggerated Alien Abduction time-pass underneath sudden power nap encounters.
