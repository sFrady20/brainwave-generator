>> [16] > 7/7 - Nia, Art, David, Carmen, Rachel, Liam, Devika
:: Nia : assertive : Okay everyone, gather around. After hearing a lot of buzz about Art's alien abduction story, I've decided to share some facts on why such stories are often unfounded. My intention here is to bring some clarity and sanity back into our workplace.
:: Art : excited : Oh, Nia, my dear, I appreciate your efforts, but I assure you, my experience was real as daylight! I bet you'll be a believer too once you hear the intricate details!
:: David : laughing : I mean, if the aliens were anything like Art, they're probably just as confused about what happened during the abduction as we are!
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Yeah, and if Art's the one they chose to abduct, they must have been really desperate for company.
:: Rachel : amused : Or maybe the aliens just wanted tips on how to survive long meetings without falling asleep, and Art here is the expert!
:: Liam : exaggerating : And let's not forget how Art single-handedly fought off an army of alien invaders before making a daring escape back to Earth!
:: Devika : jokingly : Or perhaps, these aliens were just trying to bring some Zen to the office, but after meeting Art, they realized it was a lost cause!

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : stern : Okay, enough with the jokes. Art, I understand that you believe your experience was real, but I've prepared this presentation to show you some scientific explanations that debunk many alien abduction stories. Our office needs to get back to work and focus on more grounded matters.
:: Art : defensive : Well, Nia, I'll listen to your presentation, but I must say, I've never been more sure of anything in my life! The aliens showed me the truth, and it has changed me!

== At the peak of the madness, Nia, attempting to be the voice of reason, holds a presentation on debunking alien abduction stories. However, this only fuels Art's obsession and excitement further. The characters engage in playful banter, filled with jokes and off-topic discussions, unintentionally contributing to the overall chaos and disruptions. The act showcases the office driven to the brink of total absurdity, as the characters indulge in their own comic take on Art's story.
