>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Rachel, Carmen, Marko
:: Art : excited : Friends, gather 'round and let me share with you a tale most extraordinary! I've just awoken from a power nap and within it, I was visited by beings from another world! They granted me knowledge beyond our wildest dreams!
:: Rachel : laughing : Seriously, Art? Aliens? Sounds like one heck of a nap! But alright, I'll bite - what sort of cosmic wisdom did these aliens bestow upon you?
:: Carmen : smirking : Yeah, Art, do tell! Did they teach you the secret to eternal youth, or maybe the meaning of life? I could really use that one, especially on Mondays.
:: Marko : chuckling : Or maybe they gave you some top-secret alien recipes for the ultimate space pizza, eh? We could use a good lunch option around here.

>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Liam, Marcus
:: Liam : dramatically : You guys won't believe what I just heard! Art's claiming he was visited by aliens and they've given him some crazy knowledge about the universe!
:: David : laughing : Oh man, that is bizarre even for Art! But knowing him, he'll spin it into a whole new business venture or something.
:: Marcus : grinning : And knowing Liam, he'll sell it to the highest bidder with a dramatic flair! Say, Liam, got any hot tips on stocks from Art's newfound friends from beyond the stars?
