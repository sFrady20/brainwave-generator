>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Devika, Marcus
:: Art : exasperated : Devika, Marcus, listen! I know that Nia tried to debunk my abduction story, but I still believe in it. I really need your help to convince the others. How about we create a presentation to show to the office, showing them what "really" happened during my abduction?
:: Devika : amused : Art, as bizarre as your story is, I'm always up for a creative challenge. Let's make this the most entertaining and convincing presentation Oddball Industries has ever seen!
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh, Art, you know how much I love a good shenanigan! A fantastic alien abduction presentation? Count me in! We'll have everyone eating out of our hands!

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Marcus
:: Devika : brainstorming : Alright, Marcus, let's think. We need to create vivid visuals, maybe even integrate some out-of-this-world animations. Any ideas on how we can make this as convincing as possible?
:: Marcus : grinning : Oh, Devika! I've got a spectacular idea. How about we create a scene where Art is levitated into the spaceship by a beam of light, surrounded by dancing aliens and a spinning disco ball? We can even add in some dramatic music for effect! The weirder, the better!

>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Art
:: Marcus : excited : Art, Devika and I have come up with a fantastic plan. We've designed a stunning dramatization of your abduction, complete with dancing aliens and a disco ball! We're positive that this presentation will win the hearts and minds of our colleagues!
:: Art : eager : Marcus, that sounds phenomenal! I knew I could count on you two. Let's get this presentation rolling, and soon everyone will see the truth of my otherworldly experience!

>> [16] > 7/7 - Art, Marcus, Devika, Nia, Liam, Rachel, Carmen
:: Art : triumphant : Ladies and gentlemen of Oddball Industries, I present to you the ultimate account of my alien abduction!
:: Devika : smirking : Please enjoy this dramatic re-enactment of Art's close encounter with extraterrestrial life.
:: Marcus : proudly : And remember, my dear colleagues, the truth is out there!

== Art enlists the help of Devika and Marcus to create a hilariously unconvincing dramatization of his alleged alien abduction, in an effort to regain credibility among his colleagues. Using their creative skills and quick wit, they present the tale to the office, resulting in chaos and hilarity. The act showcases the characters indulging in the absurdity of the situation, embracing their own unique quirks and humor.
