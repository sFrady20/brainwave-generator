>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, David, Carmen
:: Nia : smirking : So, David, I've heard you've come up with a new office pastime - sonnet recitation contests? How did you come up with such a wildly unexpected idea?
:: David : excitedly : Ah, Nia, you see, after the whole drill rap craze, I figured we could use something a little more... sophisticated to keep the office spirits up, without harming productivity, you know? What could be better than the classic art of sonnet recitation? It's unusual, a bit eccentric, and honestly, it's hilarious listening to everyone take a stab at it!
:: Carmen : laughing : I must admit, I had my doubts when I first heard about these sonnet showdowns, but they've turned into oddly fantastic team-building exercises. Who would've thought Marcus could come up with such a heart-wrenching ode to... office supplies?

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Rachel, Marcus
:: Rachel : amused : Marko, I've heard you've become somewhat of a sonnet aficionado lately. Care to share your latest masterpiece?
:: Marko : theatrically : Oh, Rachel, I'd be delighted! Behold, my latest magnum opus, a passionate discourse, nay, a love letter, to the unsung hero of the office world, the humble stapler! "In yonder cubicle of mundane toil, Thou stapler, sturdy, keep our papers coy! Thy binding touch, a kinship we employ, As we traverse this bureaucratic soil..."
:: Marcus : applauding : Bravo, Marko! Such poetic finesse! Hath the world ever known a tribute so stirring to the amalgam of metal and springs?

>> [5] > 3/3 - Liam, Devika, Sam
:: Liam : grinning : So, Devika, have you taken part in these sonnet shenanigans yet? Surely a creative mind like yours must be brimming with elegant verses.
:: Devika : bashful : Well, I've tried my hand at a few lines, but I'm not sure they're quite ready for the public's ears. It's surprisingly fun though, attempting to mold my thoughts into iambic pentameter. A welcomed break from coding, I'd say.
:: Sam : sarcastically : Well, I'll just stick to my security duties. I find sonnets a bit too, uh, highbrow for my taste. Instead, I've been writing haikus about the unending dread that comes from guarding an office filled with... sonnet enthusiasts.
