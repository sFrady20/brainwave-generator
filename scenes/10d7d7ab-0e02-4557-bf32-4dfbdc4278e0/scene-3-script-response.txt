>> [13] > 3/3 - Carmen, David, Liam
:: Carmen : excited : Guys, I've got the coin! Nothing seems to be happening yet, though. What if the curse is all made up?
:: David : smirking : I dunno, Carmen. We might just have to wait and see. What's the worst that could happen? A little chaos in this office could be fun!
:: Liam : grinning : Yeah, I agree with David. In fact, let's just sit back and watch what unfolds. Perhaps, we should start a little chaos ourselves. David, my man, paper airplane war?

>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, Rachel, Devika
:: Marcus : laughing : My friends, have you ever seen such a marvelous display of aerial combat? It's like a scene from a bizarre war movie!
:: Rachel : giggling : I can't believe this is happening just because of that silly coin rumor! You have to admit, though, the office sure is lively today.
:: Devika : chuckling : I've never had so much fun dodging projectiles at work! But seriously, we need to get back to our tasks soon.

>> [10] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Mike
:: Art : annoyed : Nia, this nonsense has gone on long enough! We need to put an end to this whole cursed coin charade.
:: Nia : frustrated : You're right, Art. We can't let the office fall apart over some made-up story we started as a prank. Let's gather everyone and explain the situation.
:: Mike : mockingly : The great coin conspiracy, eh? Art, you've really outdone yourself this time. You've got the whole office acting like a bunch of loons!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Carmen
:: Art : serious : Listen up, everyone! It's time to come clean. The coin curse was a prank Nia and I concocted. There is no curse, and we certainly didn't expect such chaos to ensue. 
:: Nia : apologetic : Our intention was to inject a bit of fun and excitement into the office, not cause a full-blown paper airplane war. We're sorry if we took it too far.
:: Carmen : smirking : So, there's no curse? I can't believe we fell for it. But you have to admit, the chaos was strangely enjoyable.
