title: The Great Coin Conspiracy
exposition: Rachel overhears Art and Nia discussing an ancient coin they found hidden in their office wall during a recent renovation. They casually mention that it put a strange and hilarious curse on anyone who possessed the coin, leading to peculiar mishaps and miscommunication in the office. Intrigued, Rachel relays this information as juicy gossip to David, Liam, and Carmen who all now want a turn at holding the cursed coin just for the fun of it.

rising action: Intent on experiencing the strange side effects, David, Liam, and Carmen set out on a chaotic quest to swipe the coin from Art's office. In the process, they rope Marcus, Devika, and Marko into their master plan. This leads to an epic series of sneaky conversations, concealed alliances, and covert stakeouts throughout the office involving shot-series 2, 4, 5, 12, 14, 15, 17 and 18.

climax: Carmen finally manages to get her hands on the coin during a courageous break into Art's office when the charismatic man is napping behind his desk. Once back out in the office, the employees are elated yet somewhat disappointed when nothing immediately out of the ordinary seems to happen... Until suddenly, David and Liam incite a fierce paper airplane war, sending employees scattering in strangely abrupt yet comedic slow motion around the office (primarily involving characters from gatherings 13, 18 and 22).

falling action: Now completely overtaken by the coin's supposed and somehow contagious curse, Art and Nia are forced to intervene as company productivity is plunged into absurd shenanigans.

resolution: Confronted with the hysterically drawn-out chaos, Art simulates shock and admits that they manufactured the tale of the "ancient cursed coin" entirely as a prank, contributing to a hearty laugh amongst the employees. Art recollects the coin nevertheless, Muttering something about a fascinating story about Romans battling Emus in Scotland, no one believes him this time around. Gradually the halls quiet down and a strange sense of camaraderie is present while everyone sheepishly gets back to work; though strange incidents continue to sporadically intrigue the cast, drawing chuckles from our viewers watching and expecting the absurd.
