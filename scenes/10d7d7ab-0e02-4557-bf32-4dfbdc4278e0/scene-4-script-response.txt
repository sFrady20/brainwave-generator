>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, David, Liam, Carmen
:: Art : feigning surprise : You see, the whole cursed coin tale was just a little story cooked up by Nia and me, to add a dash of absurdity to the office routine. We never imagined it would escalate into a full-blown paper airplane war!
:: Nia : chuckling : I think we vastly underestimated the power of a good story, and the willingness of our employees to dive headfirst into the bizarre. Still, I must say, it was quite entertaining to see everyone so invested in the plot.
:: David : laughing : Well, I have to hand it to you, Art. You sure had us all going. I can't believe we bought into the idea of a cursed coin causing chaos throughout the office. We may just be more gullible than we thought.
:: Liam : smirking : Gullible or not, I think it's safe to say we all had a blast participating in the grand paper airplane battle of Oddball Industries. Perhaps we should make it an annual event, eh?
:: Carmen : grinning : Oh, definitely! I'd be down for a yearly dose of absolute insanity in this office. But for now, I guess it's time we get back to our mundane tasks while occasionally reminiscing about our little airplane escapades.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Devika, Marko, Rachel
:: Marcus : cheerfully : Well, my friends, I believe we have just witnessed the Oddball version of a Roman battle against Emus in Scotland, courtesy of Art's wild imagination. What a thrill ride it has been!
:: Devika : amused : Oh, for sure! I mean, who knew a cursed coin could inspire such chaos and camaraderie? It's moments like these that make working at Oddball Industries so special.
:: Marko : reminiscing : Right you are, Devika. I'll be telling the story of today's battle to my dear goldfish, Frank. I just hope he doesn't get too jealous of our little adventure.
:: Rachel : smiling : Well, as fun as the whole charade was, I guess it's time we all return to our responsibilities. But, I must say, I am excited for the next round of unexpected shenanigans this office has to offer!
