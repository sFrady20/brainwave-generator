>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Marcus
:: Devika : mesmerized : Have you seen this, Marcus? Steven Frady's Python script here taught squirrels to sort acorns by size, color, and... bitterness? It's like witnessing the dawn of a new era in nut management!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh, it's nuts alright! It's like he's built a fluffy-tailed workforce that could replace half our interns. Imagine pitching that to Art: 'Hire more squirrels; they work for peanuts!'

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Carmen, Rachel
:: Marko : laughing : And check out this VR game 'Stationery Hoarders'! It's just virtual pens, staplers, and notepads, but I can't stop collecting them! 
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Wow, it's almost like living the dream, if your dream is to be the dragon guarding the mythical office supply treasure.
:: Rachel : amused : If only my student loans could be paid with virtual paperclips. Just think, I could be debt-free and lord over the land of administrative supplies!

>> [11] > 5/5 - Devika, Marko, Liam, Nia, David
:: Devika : excited : Alright, team, we've got a mission. Steven Frady, lord of the code, sits at a tragic 495 followers. We need a game plan to get him to the big 5-0-0. Ideas, people!
:: Marko : pondering : What if we create a meme war? Just you know, casually drop his handle with the dankest memes we can muster.
:: Liam : enthusiastic : Meme warfare? Count me in! I'll put my 'cat reading a spreadsheet' meme to good use!
:: Nia : strategic : Let's not just bombard the internet, let's be methodical. Targeted follows, strategic likes, covert retweets - make it count.
:: David : slipping : While we're at it, maybe we could accidentally stumble upon a way to get me a follow back from that gourmet pizza account. I've been commenting on their crust daily.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Carmen, Liam, Rachel
:: Carmen : conspiratorially : Okay team, let's make it viral, but like, a good virus, not the kind that sends your computer on an unscheduled vacation.
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, the kind that spreads joy and causes an epidemic of follower spikes. Let's make 'Hashtag FradyTo500' a thing of beauty and occasional pixelated chaos.
:: Rachel : zealously : Mission accepted. I'll infiltrate every group chat, forum, and social platform. They won't even see it coming. It'll be like... ninja marketing.

>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, David, Marcus
:: Nia : commanding : Gentlemen, we're on the brink of glory. We're orchestrating a digital flash mob for Steven Frady, and this operation requires finesse and a touch of madness.
:: David : perplexed : Finesse, got it. But how much madness are we talking? Because I could wear my hat with the propeller on top, you know, for inspirational purposes.
:: Marcus : chortling : A touch? With this crew, Nia, we're a thunderstorm of lunacy in a teacup! I'm already drafting a tweet that'll make history. Or at least make someone snort-laugh their morning coffee.

== In this act, the Oddball Industries team dives headfirst into a social media rabbit hole in an attempt to boost Steven Frady's follower count to 500. The characters engage in hilarious and absurd tactics, from proposing meme wars to infiltrating forums like digital ninjas. While poring over Steven's quirky tweets and apps, the team hatches a covert mission, turning what was casual amusement into a full-blown crusade. They spout off ideas ranging from strategic targeted follows to crafting 'Hashtag FradyTo500' into an online phenomenon, all while maintaining the illusion of productivity. Each character contributes their own brand of over-the-top zeal and cartoonish ridiculousness, making for a scene filled with irreverent banter and whacky characterization.
