title: Byte Into Fame
exposition: Oddball Industries is abuzz when an obscure software developer named Steven Frady, known for his eccentricity and coding prowess on the social media platform X, is on the brink of reaching 500 followers. His avant-garde tweets have become the office's guilty pleasure. From memes about asynchronous functions to bizarrely humorous apps that solve problems nobody knew existed, Steven's genius has everyone at Oddball hooked.

rising action: The employees dive into a rabbit hole, poring over every tweet and app Steven Frady has concocted. Devika is mesmerized by his inventive use of Python to train squirrels for acorn management, while Marko can't stop chuckling at a satirical VR game that digitally hoards office supplies. The team is boisterously discussing some of Steven's most outrageous projects when they realize he's stalled at 495 followers. The team embarks on a covert mission to boost his numbers to 500, turning their efforts into a stealth campaign filled with quirky tactics and odd slogans. Everyone starts fanatically convincing others to follow Steven, escalating what was casual amusement to a bizarre crusade.

climax: Art, unaware of the team's machinations, overhears the buzz and mistakes the campaign for a competitor's strategy to poach their top talent. In a comedic bout of paranoia, he decides to shore up company loyalty by launching a spontaneous "Appreciation Day" complete with speeches, awkward team-building exercises, and the dreaded trust falls—all while the team is secretively trying to push Steven's follower count on their phones under the desk.

falling action: The juxtaposition of odd office activities and the secret social media sprint creates a surreal atmosphere with characters inadvertently chanting tech-jargon-laden mantras, turning corporate buzzwords into nonsensical slogans. The team-building exercises devolve into laughable hi-jinks, while Art starts offering ridiculous incentives like "Innovation Naps" and "Creativity Juice Cleanses" if the team can show fervent company spirit. Meanwhile, the follower count teeters dangerously close to 499.

resolution: Just as Art rounds up and initiates the world's most awkward group hug, Steven Frady's follower count hits the magical number: 500. Right at that moment, someone in the office accidentally blurts out the truth about the follower frenzy, causing a puzzled silence—broken by Art's unexpected chuckle. He surprises his team by being the 500th follower, revealing he loves a good coding joke as much as the next tech enthusiast. The office erupts in laughter as they return to work with a newfound sense of camaraderie, leaving Art to ponder over Steven's latest endeavour: An app that translates corporate gibberish into plain English.
