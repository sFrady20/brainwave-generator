>> [8] > 3/3 - Devika, Marko, Carmen
:: Devika : entranced : Have you guys seen Steven Frady's latest gem? It's a food delivery app that uses quantum uncertainty to decide what you're having for dinner. You never know if you're getting pizza or a kale smoothie until it arrives. Genius!
:: Marko : chuckling : Oh, I'm all about that! It's like SchrÃ¶dinger's Takeout, right? You just hope it's not the cat delivering it. But did you see that VR game where you can't stop collecting staplers? My abs are in orbit from laughing!
:: Carmen : grinning : That's nothing! I got hooked on his meme generator. It's all about how our coffee machine is a portal to another dimension where caffeine is illegal. Imagine a world without coffee... *shudders* a truly terrifying thought.
:: Devika : nodding : It's wild, right? His brain is like a code-slinging circus. But get this, he's one click away from 500 followers! I think we should band together and get him over the finish line. It's like a moral imperative!
:: Marko : playful : Yes, let's launch Operation Frady Frenzy! I'll make posters. "Dare to follow where no feed has gone before!" What do you say, Carmen? Ready to dive into the depths of digital devotion?
:: Carmen : enthusiastic : Heck yeah! We can't have his genius lurking in the shadows of obscurity! Let's mobilize the troops and get this quirky code wizard the audience he deserves!
:: Marko : excited : With tweets like, "If life gives you lemons, make an app that turns them into renewable energy sources", how can we not rally behind this guy?!
:: Devika : determined : To the keyboards! And let no follower be left unturned! We're about to make history. Or at least, a very small dent in the social media universe.

>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Liam, Rachel
:: Liam : boastful : Nia, have you heard about the man, the myth, the legend, Steven Frady? He's about to break the internet with his 500th follower! I say we get in on this action.
:: Nia : curious : Steven Frady? The one who made that algorithm predicting the exact moment you'll crave tacos? That's impressively random. I could see Oddball's brand hitching a ride on his viral coattails. Consider me intrigued.
:: Rachel : excitable : And it's not just about the follows, people! His feed is like a unicorn in a sea of horses pure, untamed, magical coding expressions! Wait, how about "Follow Frady, Don't Be Shady"? That's hashtag-worthy, right?
:: Liam : chuckling : "Don't Be Shady"? Rachel, you're a branding powerhouse! Let's plaster it everywhere! Mugs, t-shirts, skywriting! If that doesn't scream 'Oddball's got your back, Steven', I don't know what will.
:: Nia : slyly : Let's stay low-key though. We're not starting a cult, Liam. It's a follow-fest. We can be the silent influencers, pushing the boundaries of follower dynamics. Plus, it'll be hilarious to see Art's face when he finds out.
:: Rachel : giddy : Total stealth mode. Ninja followers! I can work the front desk angle, casual conversation leads to "Oh, by the way, have you followed the prodigious Steven Frady?" Bam! Another one for the Frady train!
:: Liam : laughing : And if anyone asks, we're just spreading the joy of laughter in this oh-so-serious world. Who knew it could be so simple, and yet so diabolically fun!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, David, Samantha
:: Art : puzzled : What's this bizarre buzz creeping through the office? David, why is everyone giggling at their screens like we're a dot-com sitcom from the nineties?
:: David : innocently : Oh, Art, you've been missing out on the digital Picasso that is Steven Frady. His code snippets could make a motherboard weep with joy. He's the Beethoven of binary, the Shakespeare of software!
:: Samantha : stern : I'm keeping an eye on this so-called frenzy. We can't have the staff distracted by online antics. If it's a competitor's ruse, we'll need to double down on office security. Maybe even install a moat.
:: Art : alarmed : A moat? Do you think we're under siege, Samantha? Alert! Everyone, grab your metaphorical digital swords, we've got a tech Trojan horse at our gates! 
:: David : chuckling : I don't think it's that kind of battle, boss. It's more like a wholesome race to shower someone with internet points. But I get it, why rely on likes when you've got loyalty, right?
:: Samantha : suspicious : Internet points can't guard these halls. But if this Frady fellow is the cause of all this commotion, I'll stand guard over the Wi-Fi router myself. Nobody out-clicks Samantha Wilson.
:: Art : decisive : No, we shall engage in the time-honored tradition of company spirit! Prepare the banner of Oddball unity, and let the office games begin! To the break room, for morale and muffins!

>> [21] > 2/2 - Mike, Samantha
:: Mike : amused : Sam, have you caught wind of the latest office shenanigan? They're all rallying behind some cyber maestro to bump his followers.
:: Samantha : gruff : Followers? What, like minions? Sounds like a cult. Next thing you know, they'll be wearing hooded robes and chanting binary code around a server.
:: Mike : snickering : No, not that kind of following. Though, the hooded robes do add a touch of drama. It's more like a pack of digital cheerleaders rooting for the underdog.
:: Samantha : unimpressed : Cheerleaders? In my security office? Over my dead motherboard. They want cheers, I'll give 'em a "Hurrah" as I toss 'em out the front door.
:: Mike : mischievous : Oh, come on, Sam. Where's your sense of online adventure? We could be witnessing the birth of the next big thing in geek culture. Don't you want to be part of the legend?
:: Samantha : grumbling : I've seen enough "legends" come and go. The only thing I'm witnessing is a decline in productivity. If Art asks, I'm blaming it on solar flares. Interfering with the brain's logical circuitry.
:: Mike : playful : That's the spirit! Solar flares it is. But between you and me, I'm Team Frady all the way. Don't tell anyone, but I'm about to become his 496th follower. Stealth mode engaged.

== In this act, Oddball Industries employees are consumed by the peculiar brilliance of Steven Frady, an eccentric software developer on the brink of internet fame. Devika, Marko, and Carmen brainstorms in the media room, plotting to inch Steven towards an epic 500 followers, while Nia, Liam, and Rachel strategize their approach in Nia's office with catchy hashtags. Art, David, and Samantha discuss the buzz, with Art mistaking the situation for a competitor threat, and deciding on an impromptu "Appreciation Day" to reinforce company loyalty. Finally, Mike and Samantha chat in the security office about the hype with Samantha skeptical and Mike covertly joining the Frady fanfare. The office is a mix of fanatical follower acquisition and the beginning of Art's odd office morale-boosting activities.
