>> [19] > 3/3 - Art Beecham, Nia Jones, Liam O'Connell
:: Art Beecham : alarmed : I can feel it in my bones, Nia, like the static shock from a furry blanket. There's chitter-chatter in the air, and it reeks of corporate espionage! What if our competitors are plotting to swipe our brainiest brains right from under our collective nose?
:: Nia Jones : patronizingly : Oh, Art, breathe in, breathe out. We're just a small software company, not a James Bond flick. The closest we've come to espionage is Carmen mistaking the whiteboard eraser for a listening device.
:: Liam O'Connell : boastfully : But what if Art's onto something? Picture it: Spy vs. Spy, but it's us vs. them. I could totally rock a trench coat, maybe get one of those cool secret-agent earpieces. I'd look good, admit it.
:: Art Beecham : inspired : No time for fashion shows, Liam! We must act with the swiftness of a caffeinated cheetah. Henceforth, I declare today to be Oddball Appreciation Day! Marathons of motivational monologues and team-building tomfoolery will commence posthaste!
:: Nia Jones : sarcastically : Super. Can't wait for a rousing game of 'Catch Me If I Fall and I Promise Not to Sue.' Should I pencil in a group cry to the schedule, or would that be off-brand?
:: Liam O'Connell : mischievously : And, I've got the perfect icebreaker! How about trust falls off the roof! Adds a bit of thrill, don't you think? You can thank me later.
:: Art Beecham : decisively : No roofs, Liam. Let's not test our insurance policies just yet. Assemble the troops in the break room. It's time for speeches and artificially enforced bonding. My heart swells with the power of middle-management enthusiasm!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus Okonkwo, David Kent, Rachel Johnson, Carmen Vega, Devika Sharma
:: Marcus Okonkwo : whispering : Psst, gather round my digital comrades! We must keep our thumbs nimble and wits about us. Artï¿½s going on a company spirit crusade, and we've got a follower count to inflate to 500 for our beloved Frady! Stealth mode, people.
:: David Kent : chuckling : Just imagine trying to explain this to past generations. 'Yeah, we united in secret to digitally applaud a man's online squirrel management system. No biggie.' 
:: Rachel Johnson : giddy : I'm not saying I'm a follower cult leader, but if convincing the masses to worship at the temple of Frady is wrong, I don't want to be right.
:: Carmen Vega : playfully : This is like a secret society meets online flash mob. We'll be like, By the power vested in us by the WiFi gods, we dub thee, Sir Steven of Frady, the 500th followed!
:: Devika Sharma : seriously : Code Red, you guys, Art's on the move! Look busy, and whatever you do, don't let him see your screens. It'll take more than a nosy CEO to stop the Great Frady Frenzy of 2023!
:: Marcus Okonkwo : dramatically : If we must fall, let us fall like the Spartans of old, with our phones clutched in our heroic grip and our last tweet sent to the heavens above! Frady or bust!

>> [20] > 6/6 - Art Beecham, Nia Jones, Liam O'Connell, Carmen Vega, Marcus Okonkwo, David Kent
:: Art Beecham : beaming : Ladies and gentlemen of Oddball Industries, I stand before you today to herald the dawn of a new era of unity! Our competitors may circle like vultures, but we are the mighty phoenix, rising from the ashes of burnt-out hard drives and inefficiency!
:: Nia Jones : humorously : Art, you should moonlight as a poet. Ode to the Almighty Task Manager. It'll be a hit in the Silicon Valley slam circuits.
:: Liam O'Connell : enthusiastically : Now, who's ready to literally fall backwards into the arms of corporate synergy? I'm talking trust falls, people. The ultimate leap of faith, minus the leap... and the faith.
:: Carmen Vega : jokingly : I'm all for trust, but my instincts say catching Liam might be a workout I'm not prepared for. How about a trust handshake instead?
:: Marcus Okonkwo : knowingly : Fear not, fellow trust-faller, for I have been secretly training for this day by catching falling leaves in the park. My reflexes are as sharp as our cybersecurity protocols!
:: David Kent : slyly : As we stand here, Art, poised to catch and be caught, I just wonder... if we're the phoenix, does that make the copier the dragon we must slay? Because I swear it's been hoarding my documents like treasure.
:: Art Beecham : proudly : Ah, the spirit of Oddball flows through this room like an unlicensed software patch! We shall dive, fall, and awkwardly embrace our way into an unbreakable bond. To the trust fall stations!

== In this act, Art Beecham launches Oddball Appreciation Day in a hilarious bout of paranoia, starting with a rousing speech in his office involving Nia and Liam. The team, meanwhile, is secretly trying to boost Steven Frady's followers on social media. The employees engage in comedic banter, poking fun at Art's initiatives while covertly progressing their campaign. They plan to carry out their club-like activities under the guise of participating in Art's awkward team-building exercises, which includes trust falls in the break room accompanied by Art's dramatic and motivating speeches. The act ends in the office party room where Art is delivering a speech filled with corporate jargon, while the team plots their moves under the table. The comedy is derived from the absurd lengths to which the team goes to support Frady under Art's unwitting nose.
