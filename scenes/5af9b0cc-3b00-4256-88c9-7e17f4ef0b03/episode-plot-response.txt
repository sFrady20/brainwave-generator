title: Enlightenment & Confusion
exposition: Marcus returns to the office after a vacation to Tibet during which he learns about meditation and somehow immediately reaches enlightenment. Excited about his newfound wisdom, he decides to share what he's learned with his coworkers, hoping to help them find their inner peace.

rising action: Marcus tries to share the depth of his enlightenment with various coworkers through metaphors and sayings he learned, but no one can understand his cryptic messages. He attempts to infuse a different spiritual lesson in each interaction, perplexing people more and more as he pushes on relentlessly. Their overall confusion continues to increase as his language becomes more entangled and enigmatic with each attempt at enlightenment sharing.

climax: Marcus gathers as many staff members as he can to hold an unplanned office-wide extra-rambling session on his newfound wisdom. Unfortunately, this interrupted the CEO, Art, who was napping, and an important decision needed to be made. Art starts to panic, as the incomprehensible spiritualism seems to be taking over the entire office.

falling action: Desperate to fix the mess he's created, rather than help his colleagues unwind, Marcus reaches out for Rachel's unconventional, direct approach to simplify all of his teachings. Rachel bluntly advises them both on getting closer to other practices rather than pushing everyone aggressively to follow Marcus' journey.

resolution: Marcus acknowledges that, while his spiritual journey suits him well, others have their ways, and it might not be morally correct to force the same path upon them. So, he agrees to respect his coworkers' differences in finding their grounding but spreads less-confusing invitations towards his teachings if anyone feels curious. Art finally agrees to the challenges of buddhist meditation to calm his thoughts before important meetings, artfully avoiding his daily power naps. The office regains its quirky equilibrium as Marcus picks back up goodwill and valuable interactions from the coworkers eagerly.
