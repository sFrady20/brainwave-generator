>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, Liam, Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : Friends, coworkers, fellow seekers of enlightenment, gather around! I have returned from my journey to the mountains of Tibet, and I bring with me wisdom beyond measure! With it, we shall unravel the great mysteries of the universe, decode the secret language of the cosmos, and, of course, boost office productivity!
:: Liam : skeptical : Marcus, mate, I'm all for a good yarn, but in the middle of the workday? We've got deadlines, you know. Can't your cosmic epiphanies wait until lunchtime?
:: Rachel : curious : Actually, I'm intrigued. Can't resist a bit of juicy enlightenment with my morning coffee. What nuggets of wisdom did you dig up in Tibet, Marcus?
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, Marcus, did you find the secret to not accidentally spilling coffee all over yourself? Because I could really use that knowledge right about now.
:: Carmen : amused : Or maybe the secret to finding the perfect excuse to ditch work for a few hours in the middle of the afternoon? I'm all ears!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : groggily : What's all that ruckus out there? Can't a CEO catch a few winks without the whole office going haywire?
:: Nia : concerned : Art, Marcus is back from his trip, and he's holding an impromptu enlightenment session in the break room. It's disrupting the workflow, and we have an important decision to make today.
:: Devika : excited : But Nia, what if Marcus has discovered the key to unlocking our full potential? The productivity boost might be worth the temporary disturbance!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, Liam, Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : dramatically : Behold, the ancient mantra that, when recited correctly, shall bring forth great clarity and focus: "Ommmm...GIF-cat-pineapple-meme...Ommmm." Trust me, my friends, you will soon be swept away by the unstoppable current of cosmic consciousness.
:: Liam : sarcastically : Right, and next you'll be telling us that the meaning of life is a hashtag or a viral TikTok dance.
:: David : snickering : Call me old school, but I still believe the best mantra for productivity is, “Just get the darn work done and then you can goof off."
:: Rachel : amused : You know what, Marcus? Your intriguing mantra made me realize that we’ve all got our coping mechanisms to make it through the workday. The important thing is to respect each other's quirks and not impose our own ideas on others.
:: Carmen : nodding : I couldn't agree more, Rachel. Now, if you all don't mind, I have a date with my favorite coffee machine. A double espresso calls for my attention.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : reluctantly : Well, I suppose we can't control every aspect of this office. Perhaps I should consider embracing this...unconventional wisdom, even if it's just to improve my decision-making skills.
:: Nia : supportive : Art, that's a great attitude! It's important to be open-minded and embrace new ideas. We don't want our office to become stagnant.
:: Devika : enthusiastic : Plus, who knows? We might even find some unexpected inspiration from Marcus' teachings. After all, innovation comes from the most unlikely places!
