>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : grinning : You guys won't believe what just happened to me! I went on vacation to Tibet and reached enlightenment! I'm basically a spiritual guru now, right? Anyway, I want to share the wisdom I've learned with all of you, so you can find your inner peace.
:: David : chuckling : Well, congrats on the guru status, Marcus! I had no clue you had the ability to transform into a spiritual master just like that. But hey, I'm always up for a good life lesson, especially if it comes with some laughs.
:: Carmen : smirking : So, Marcus the Enlightened One, what sage advice do you have for us mere mortals? I'm curious to see how you can bestow inner peace upon us all in this chaotic place called Oddball Industries.

>> [3] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Rachel
:: Marcus : cryptically : The path to enlightenment is like a mongoose dancing on the wings of a dragonfly, my friends. Sometimes the slightest breeze can shift your focus, and it's important to remain grounded like an oak tree in a storm.
:: David : puzzled : Uh, so... instead of being a mongoose on a dragonfly, we should be an oak tree in a storm? Or are we dragonflies? I gotta admit, I'm lost here, Marcus.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Don't you see, David? We're all mongooses, dragonflies, and oak trees, all at once! It's so simple! Seriously, Marcus, I'm all for spiritual wisdom, but you've got to give us something we can actually understand!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, Nia, Liam, Devika, Marko
:: Marcus : enthusiastically : Gather 'round, everyone! I have more lessons from my journey in Tibet to share with you all. Like the ancient saying goes: "When the yak's tail flicks, the mountain moves." Deep, right?
:: Nia : skeptically : I'm not so sure about that one, Marcus. I mean, I'm all for a good metaphor, but are you implying that a tiny action can cause great change? Or are we just talking about yaks and mountains?
:: Liam : grinning : Maybe it's about not underestimating the little things in life? Or, alternatively, Marcus has officially lost it and is just spouting gibberish.
:: Devika : amused : I'm leaning towards the gibberish theory myself, but I'm curious to see what other gems Marcus has to share with us!
:: Marko : laughing : Yeah, mate, keep 'em coming! Oddball Industries could always use a taste of that sweet, sweet enlightenment! Or is it confusion? I can't tell anymore!

== In this act, Marcus returns to the office after his journey to Tibet and tries to share his newfound enlightenment with his coworkers, but winds up just confusing them with his cryptic sayings and metaphors. The act is filled with twisted phrases, offbeat humor, and irreverent banter as the characters try to make sense of what Marcus is trying to convey. Throughout the act, humor is derived from the characters' increasingly puzzled reactions to Marcus' spiritual teachings, as well as their own attempts to decipher the true meaning of his words. The act ends with a sense of anticipation and curiosity about what other bizarre sayings Marcus might share with the office.
