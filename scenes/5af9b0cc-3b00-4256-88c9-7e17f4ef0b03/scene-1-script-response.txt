>> [15] > 4/5 - Marcus, Liam, Rachel, David
:: Marcus : excited : Friends, I have returned from my spiritual journey! I have discovered the infinite wisdom at the core of the universe, the essence of all existence, and I wish to share it with you all!
:: Liam : sarcastic : Oh, perfect, just what we needed. More wisdom from the mystic lands. What kind of deep, cryptic lessons have you brought back with you, Marcus?
:: Marcus : cryptic : Ah, Liam, my good friend! Allow me to share the first pearl of wisdom: "When the snow melts on the mountain, the secrets of the valley will be revealed." Now, isn't that something to ponder over?
:: Rachel : confused : Uhm, sure... but what does that even mean, Marcus? What kind of secret are we talking about here?
:: David : laughing : Marcus, are you just making this stuff up as you go along? I mean, it sounds like something you'd find on an Instagram caption or a fortune cookie.

>> [11] > 4/5 - Marcus, Art, Devika, Carmen
:: Marcus : enigmatic : Greetings, Art, Devika, and Carmen! The second pearl of wisdom I've collected on my journey is this: "The wind carries the seeds of change, but only the patient soil can nurture them." Consider the implications this may have on our daily lives!
:: Art : intrigued : Well, Marcus, that's... interesting. But how exactly does that apply to running a software company?
:: Devika : skeptical : Marcus, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not sure how this wisdom is supposed to help us with our tasks.
:: Carmen : smirking : You know, Marcus, the metaphors are dense, but I'm always up for an adventure in deciphering! Keep 'em coming, buddy.

>> [5] > 3/3 - Marcus, Nia, Marko
:: Marcus : passionate : Nia, Marko! It is time for the third pearl of wisdom I've acquired: "A still pond reflects the truth, a raging river obscures it. Find your own stillness and embrace it." I believe this can help us reflect on our lives and find a deeper meaning.
:: Nia : smiling : That's... very abstract, Marcus. But I guess I can appreciate the thought behind it.
:: Marko : grinning : Crikey, Marcus! You really turned into a spiritual guru, didn't you? So, what's the next lesson? Something about hugging trees or talking to animals, mate?
