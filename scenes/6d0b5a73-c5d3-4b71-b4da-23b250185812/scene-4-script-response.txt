>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Marcus, Liam, Rachel
:: Nia : amused : Well, I must say that the whole brain-gate event has been a wild ride. We should probably thank Devika for her unintentional contribution to the office excitement.
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : Agreed, Nia! The brain mystery definitely added some intrigue to our mundane routine. But, as I've always said, the truth is out there, and I will continue my quest to uncover the hidden secrets lurking within these office walls. 
:: Liam : grinning : Well, Marcus, as long as your investigations don't involve any more slimy creations, I think we'll all be just fine.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Yeah, let's just make sure we don't trip over any alien tentacles on our way to the break room, alright?

>> [18] > 3/3 - Carmen, David, Art
:: Carmen : laughing : I can't believe we all fell for the brain thing! We should've known it was something ridiculous like Devika's slime experiments.
:: David : chuckling : Right? Honestly, I'm just glad we're back to normal. I was starting to worry that I might have to watch some alien invasion safety videos online.
:: Art : smiling : Well, you know what they say, every office needs a little chaos now and then. It keeps things interesting. Plus, it gives us something to talk about at the next company party.

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Nia
:: Devika : sheepishly : Nia, I am so sorry about the mess with the slime brains. I just got so caught up in my experiments that I forgot about them.
:: Nia : reassuring : It's okay, Devika. Honestly, it was a nice change of pace around here. Just try not to leave any more... surprises lying around, alright?

>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Liam
:: Marcus : scheming : Liam, I've been thinking. Although we've solved the brain object mystery, there's still much more to uncover. What do you say we start our own secret conspiracy club to investigate the unknown?
:: Liam : grinning : Marcus, you have a way with words that makes even the most ridiculous ideas sound intriguing. Count me in. But let's not forget to have a little fun while we're at it, shall we?
