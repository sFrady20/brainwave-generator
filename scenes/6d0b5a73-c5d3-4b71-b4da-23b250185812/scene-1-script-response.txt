>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : excited : Gather around, my fellow Oddball Investigators! I have some earth-shattering news to share with all of you! The mysterious brains that have been appearing throughout the office are not a random fluke; there's a secret conspiracy behind them! I've been connecting the dots, and I have a list of suspects that may be linked to these peculiar objects.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, fantastic! Just what we need, Marcus' paranoia running wild around the office. Go on then, who are these alleged brain conspirators?
:: David : chuckling : I bet it's the Illuminati. They're always up to something, right?
:: Marcus : defensive : No, David! This is serious business! I've narrowed it down to a few possible suspects, and I need your help to uncover the truth. We must work together to find the mastermind behind these brain-like objects.
:: Carmen : laughing : This ought to be good. Who made the list, Marcus?

>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, Liam, Nia
:: Marcus : proudly : Our first suspect is none other than... Liam! With his smooth-talking ways and risk-taking tendencies, he seems like the perfect candidate to orchestrate a brain-related conspiracy.
:: Liam : amused : Really, Marcus? You think I have time to run around, planting weird slime brains all over the office? I'm too busy closing deals and being awesome, mate.
:: Nia : sternly : I'll admit, Liam's behavior can be a bit...questionable at times, but I highly doubt he's the one behind this.
:: Marcus : relenting : Fine, fine. Let's move on to our next suspect... Devika! She's always thinking outside the box, and those brain things have her name written all over them. Maybe it's some sort of experimental project?
:: Nia : considering : Well, that does sound like something she might do. Maybe we should check her work area for clues.

>> [7] > 2/2 - Marcus, Devika
:: Devika : flustered : What do we have here, my favorite amateur detective? If you're looking for evidence that I'm the brains behind the brains, I'm afraid you're barking up the wrong tree. I can hardly remember where I put my coffee mug, let alone create and distribute odd objects.
:: Marcus : disappointed : I suppose that's true - you're a bit too scatterbrained to pull off something like this. Mind if I take a look around, though? I need to rule you out as a suspect before I can move on.
:: Devika : rolling her eyes : Go ahead, investigate all you want. But don't blame me if you find yourself sucked into a parallel dimension or something. My ideas can be pretty...spirited.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, Art, Nia, Carmen, David
:: Marcus : energized : Alright folks, after a thorough interrogation process, it seems we're no closer to solving the mystery of the brain-like objects. But fear not! I have a plan. We must stake out the office after hours, and catch the perpetrator in the act!
:: Art : sleepily : Ah, an after-hours stakeout? Sounds like a fun adventure. I'll make sure to bring the coffee and donuts.
:: Nia : skeptical : Marcus, are you sure this isn't just your overactive imagination running wild? This all seems a bit far-fetched.
:: Marcus : determined : I'm certain there's more to this than meets the eye. We must uncover the truth, even if it means working round the clock!
:: Carmen : grinning : Well, if nothing else, it'll make for a great night of ghost stories and office high jinks.
