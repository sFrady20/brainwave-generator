>> [11] > 3/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : conspiratorial : I've just discovered something absolutely mind-blowing! There could be paranormal creatures living in our building! Mysterious objects that look like human brains have been appearing all around the office. I can't help but think there's something fishy going on...
:: David : laughing : I thought you were going to say they were leftovers from Devika's lunch! Hahaha! But seriously, Marcus, do you think we have some kind of office haunting? Are we about to be overrun by brain-seeking ghouls or something?
:: Carmen : chuckling : I don't know if I should be intrigued or terrified by this theory of yours, Marcus. But hey, it would definitely liven up the daily grind around here if we had a few paranormal pals joining us.

>> [17] > 1/2 - Liam, Rachel
:: Liam : embellishing : So, Rachel, have you heard about the weird human brain-like objects popping up all over the place? Good thing I keep my tinfoil hat at the ready. You never know when you'll need protection from paranormal forces.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely, Liam. I'm sure those objects are out to get us. Could make for a great office thriller movie, though. "Oddball Industries: The Haunting of the Cerebral Impostors!" 

>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Devika
:: Nia : earnest : Devika, have you noticed anything strange happening in the office? Marcus has been spreading rumors about some mysterious objects resembling human brains. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but we need to address this before it causes any more chaos.
:: Devika : distracted : Huh, you know, now that you mention it, Nia, I might be responsible for some of those objects… I've been experimenting with this homemade slime project for fun, and I might've left a few prototypes lying around. Oops!

>> [1] > 4/4 - Art, Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Art : intrigued : I must admit, I find this brain-slime fiasco quite entertaining. Marcus, let's establish an official Oddball Industries Paranormal Investigation Team. Our first mission: finding the source of these mysterious objects!
:: Marcus : ecstatic : Art, I knew I could count on you to see the potential in this investigation! We shall uncover the truth - no matter how deep the conspiracy goes!
:: David : chuckling : And here I was thinking today was going to be another boring day at the office! Let the brain hunt begin!
:: Carmen : amused : I have to say, I've never been more excited to come to work. Let's do this, team!
