>> [11] > 3/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : conspiratorial : I've just discovered something absolutely mind-blowing! There could be paranormal creatures living in our building! Mysterious objects that look like human brains have been appearing all around the office. I can't help but think there's something fishy going on...
:: David : laughing : I thought you were going to say they were leftovers from Devika's lunch! Hahaha! But seriously, Marcus, do you think we have some kind of office haunting? Are we about to be overrun by brain-seeking ghouls or something?
:: Carmen : chuckling : I don't know if I should be intrigued or terrified by this theory of yours, Marcus. But hey, it would definitely liven up the daily grind around here if we had a few paranormal pals joining us.
>> [17] > 1/2 - Liam, Rachel
:: Liam : embellishing : So, Rachel, have you heard about the weird human brain-like objects popping up all over the place? Good thing I keep my tinfoil hat at the ready. You never know when you'll need protection from paranormal forces.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely, Liam. I'm sure those objects are out to get us. Could make for a great office thriller movie, though. "Oddball Industries: The Haunting of the Cerebral Impostors!" 
>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Devika
:: Nia : earnest : Devika, have you noticed anything strange happening in the office? Marcus has been spreading rumors about some mysterious objects resembling human brains. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but we need to address this before it causes any more chaos.
:: Devika : distracted : Huh, you know, now that you mention it, Nia, I might be responsible for some of those objects… I've been experimenting with this homemade slime project for fun, and I might've left a few prototypes lying around. Oops!
>> [1] > 4/4 - Art, Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Art : intrigued : I must admit, I find this brain-slime fiasco quite entertaining. Marcus, let's establish an official Oddball Industries Paranormal Investigation Team. Our first mission: finding the source of these mysterious objects!
:: Marcus : ecstatic : Art, I knew I could count on you to see the potential in this investigation! We shall uncover the truth - no matter how deep the conspiracy goes!
:: David : chuckling : And here I was thinking today was going to be another boring day at the office! Let the brain hunt begin!
:: Carmen : amused : I have to say, I've never been more excited to come to work. Let's do this, team!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : excited : Gather around, my fellow Oddball Investigators! I have some earth-shattering news to share with all of you! The mysterious brains that have been appearing throughout the office are not a random fluke; there's a secret conspiracy behind them! I've been connecting the dots, and I have a list of suspects that may be linked to these peculiar objects.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, fantastic! Just what we need, Marcus' paranoia running wild around the office. Go on then, who are these alleged brain conspirators?
:: David : chuckling : I bet it's the Illuminati. They're always up to something, right?
:: Marcus : defensive : No, David! This is serious business! I've narrowed it down to a few possible suspects, and I need your help to uncover the truth. We must work together to find the mastermind behind these brain-like objects.
:: Carmen : laughing : This ought to be good. Who made the list, Marcus?
>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, Liam, Nia
:: Marcus : proudly : Our first suspect is none other than... Liam! With his smooth-talking ways and risk-taking tendencies, he seems like the perfect candidate to orchestrate a brain-related conspiracy.
:: Liam : amused : Really, Marcus? You think I have time to run around, planting weird slime brains all over the office? I'm too busy closing deals and being awesome, mate.
:: Nia : sternly : I'll admit, Liam's behavior can be a bit...questionable at times, but I highly doubt he's the one behind this.
:: Marcus : relenting : Fine, fine. Let's move on to our next suspect... Devika! She's always thinking outside the box, and those brain things have her name written all over them. Maybe it's some sort of experimental project?
:: Nia : considering : Well, that does sound like something she might do. Maybe we should check her work area for clues.
>> [7] > 2/2 - Marcus, Devika
:: Devika : flustered : What do we have here, my favorite amateur detective? If you're looking for evidence that I'm the brains behind the brains, I'm afraid you're barking up the wrong tree. I can hardly remember where I put my coffee mug, let alone create and distribute odd objects.
:: Marcus : disappointed : I suppose that's true - you're a bit too scatterbrained to pull off something like this. Mind if I take a look around, though? I need to rule you out as a suspect before I can move on.
:: Devika : rolling her eyes : Go ahead, investigate all you want. But don't blame me if you find yourself sucked into a parallel dimension or something. My ideas can be pretty...spirited.
>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, Art, Nia, Carmen, David
:: Marcus : energized : Alright folks, after a thorough interrogation process, it seems we're no closer to solving the mystery of the brain-like objects. But fear not! I have a plan. We must stake out the office after hours, and catch the perpetrator in the act!
:: Art : sleepily : Ah, an after-hours stakeout? Sounds like a fun adventure. I'll make sure to bring the coffee and donuts.
:: Nia : skeptical : Marcus, are you sure this isn't just your overactive imagination running wild? This all seems a bit far-fetched.
:: Marcus : determined : I'm certain there's more to this than meets the eye. We must uncover the truth, even if it means working round the clock!
:: Carmen : grinning : Well, if nothing else, it'll make for a great night of ghost stories and office high jinks.
>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Art
:: Art : bewildered : Devika, I can't help but overhear you talking about some missing homemade slime from your desk. It's been causing quite a ruckus around here.
:: Devika : scratching her head : Yeah, Art. I made this really cool slime that looked like human brains for a tech fair, but I keep misplacing them all over the office. I guess that's what happens when you're always thinking of new ideas and get easily distracted.
:: Art : chuckling : Well, that certainly explains the chaos Marcus had been causing with his impromptu paranormal investigation! I think it's time to put these rumors to rest.
>> [16] > 6/7 - Art, Marcus, Nia, David, Liam, Carmen
:: Art : addressing everyone : Alright, folks, listen up! It turns out the mysterious brain-like objects have been nothing more than Devika's misplaced slime creations. So, no paranormal activity or conspiracy theories here.
:: Marcus : disappointed : Aww, man, I was really hoping to uncover something dark and uncanny. We could have started our own Oddballs Investigations show!
:: David : snickering : Don't worry, Marcus. We'll just have to let go of our dreams of becoming internet sensations for now. 
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : I think we have more important things to focus on, like keeping this company afloat and improving our productivity.
:: Liam : smirking : Hey, don't forget about the amazing sales numbers I'll be pulling in! Besides, we need a bit of excitement here every now and then.
:: Carmen : agreeing : Yeah, even though it was all a misunderstanding, it was pretty fun to see everyone's reactions to those slimy brains!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Marcus, Liam, Rachel
:: Nia : amused : Well, I must say that the whole brain-gate event has been a wild ride. We should probably thank Devika for her unintentional contribution to the office excitement.
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : Agreed, Nia! The brain mystery definitely added some intrigue to our mundane routine. But, as I've always said, the truth is out there, and I will continue my quest to uncover the hidden secrets lurking within these office walls. 
:: Liam : grinning : Well, Marcus, as long as your investigations don't involve any more slimy creations, I think we'll all be just fine.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Yeah, let's just make sure we don't trip over any alien tentacles on our way to the break room, alright?
>> [18] > 3/3 - Carmen, David, Art
:: Carmen : laughing : I can't believe we all fell for the brain thing! We should've known it was something ridiculous like Devika's slime experiments.
:: David : chuckling : Right? Honestly, I'm just glad we're back to normal. I was starting to worry that I might have to watch some alien invasion safety videos online.
:: Art : smiling : Well, you know what they say, every office needs a little chaos now and then. It keeps things interesting. Plus, it gives us something to talk about at the next company party.
>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Nia
:: Devika : sheepishly : Nia, I am so sorry about the mess with the slime brains. I just got so caught up in my experiments that I forgot about them.
:: Nia : reassuring : It's okay, Devika. Honestly, it was a nice change of pace around here. Just try not to leave any more... surprises lying around, alright?
>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Liam
:: Marcus : scheming : Liam, I've been thinking. Although we've solved the brain object mystery, there's still much more to uncover. What do you say we start our own secret conspiracy club to investigate the unknown?
:: Liam : grinning : Marcus, you have a way with words that makes even the most ridiculous ideas sound intriguing. Count me in. But let's not forget to have a little fun while we're at it, shall we?
