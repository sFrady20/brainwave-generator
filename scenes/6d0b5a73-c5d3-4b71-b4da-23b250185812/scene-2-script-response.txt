>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Liam
:: Marcus : manically grinning : Fellas, feast your eyes on these incriminating photographs! Marko, caught in an unexpected pocket of space with strange conspiracy imagery - crop circles, aliens, you name it!
:: David : sarcastically : Oh, sure, 'cause crop circles and aliens are totally the same thing as these brain-like blobs, right? Genius, Marcus.
:: Liam : amused : So, who is this dastardly accomplice of Marko's? An alien connection, perhaps?
:: Marcus : dramatically : From various untraceable sources, I have discovered the mastermind behind this mysterious conspiracy... Frank, Marko's pet goldfish!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Rachel, Carmen, Devika
:: Nia : laughing : So, Marcus thinks Frank the goldfish is behind all of this? Man, that's some next-level internet humor right there.
:: Rachel : smirking : It's like watching a real-life meme unfold in the office. I can't wait to see how Marko reacts to this bizarre accusation!
:: Carmen : giggling : I almost feel bad for Marko, but hey, it's a distraction from the everyday office drudgery, right? Pass the popcorn!
:: Devika : chuckling : I know it's ridiculous, but I'm secretly rooting for Frank. Maybe he's a goldfish genius plotting world domination!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Marcus, David, Liam, Marko
:: Art : grinning : Marcus, I gotta hand it to you. This whole conspiracy adventure has livened up the office in ways I couldn't have imagined. Frank the goldfish as the mastermind? It's nonsensical, cartoonish, and the perfect break from reality!
:: Marcus : proudly : I live to entertain, Art! And let's not forget, we're hot on the trail of discovering the truth behind these mysterious brain-like objects.
:: David : rolling his eyes : Yeah, or we could've, you know, asked Devika about her slime experiments or something. But no, let's blame the goldfish.
:: Liam : teasing : Oh, come on, David. Lighten up. It's all in good fun. Plus, it's not like we had anything better to do!
:: Marko : jokingly indignant : So, my dear Frank is the mastermind, huh? Well, I'll have you know he's a goldfish of impeccable character! I'll be watching you, Marcus. RuntimeObjectReviewGuru3000
