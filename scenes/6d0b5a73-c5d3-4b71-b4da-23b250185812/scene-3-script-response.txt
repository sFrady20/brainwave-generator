>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Art
:: Art : bewildered : Devika, I can't help but overhear you talking about some missing homemade slime from your desk. It's been causing quite a ruckus around here.
:: Devika : scratching her head : Yeah, Art. I made this really cool slime that looked like human brains for a tech fair, but I keep misplacing them all over the office. I guess that's what happens when you're always thinking of new ideas and get easily distracted.
:: Art : chuckling : Well, that certainly explains the chaos Marcus had been causing with his impromptu paranormal investigation! I think it's time to put these rumors to rest.

:: Marcus : disappointed : Aww, man, I was really hoping to uncover something dark and uncanny. We could have started our own Oddballs Investigations show!
:: David : snickering : Don't worry, Marcus. We'll just have to let go of our dreams of becoming internet sensations for now. 
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : I think we have more important things to focus on, like keeping this company afloat and improving our productivity.
:: Liam : smirking : Hey, don't forget about the amazing sales numbers I'll be pulling in! Besides, we need a bit of excitement here every now and then.
:: Carmen : agreeing : Yeah, even though it was all a misunderstanding, it was pretty fun to see everyone's reactions to those slimy brains!
