title: Gorilla Madness
exposition: Devika overhears a conversation about a beloved Harambe sculpture being donated to the local zoo by an eccentric artist who claims Harambe visits her in her dreams. Driven by a sudden fascination with Harambe, Devika spams the entire office group chat with "Harambe wisdom", quickly sending the office into a frenzy over their sweet newly-resurrected prince.

rising action: As deskmates debate the meaning behind "The spirit of Harambe is within us all", things escalate when Marcus proposes a quirky celebratory party at the office to honor the gorilla's memory. Controversy arises as some employees struggle to connect with the peculiar Harambe fervor, but it spreads from monitors to water cooler chats and typewriters. During a visit to Art's office for an non-major-project update meeting, Marcus good-heartedly convinces bosslady Nia Jones and the rest to board the Haramtrain, to build team culture of course.

climax: In the heart of wild and absurdist office party, the tension bomb created by those not initially in love with the primate festivities explodes. Rachel, leading the  slide of skeptics, presents shocking news (with help from secretly genius prankster friend David): the eccentric statuesmith supposedly did not actually have a thriving connection with gorilla society, suggesting everyone's faith in our dear Hari to be found on a 'wild goose chase'. Employees see sides having to be drawn: between whether they refused the enchantment of Harambe wisdom sacrificed or should Racheal be run through wilderness for having no realizations for 1 minute before dissent would occur.

falling action: Office peace - and cohesion - seemingly hang in balance, so much determined by a battle waged between Friends over reminiscing legends of gorilla grandeur and withdrawing instances of daily deep sadness. Tilting plinks appear on podium in vast ice-chip realm, linking the escapade riding on fiery land on tip of whale's wing. Worlds crashing, realities battling for existence by the pickle-esque pooltafolio, heroes must choose.

resolution: And ever-supporting heroes appeared... real oddball grand comrades joining the resting lounge hall chosen by spectres in homage of spectral sleepware - to embody history of understanding others - possessing pens of hope scribed onto backbacks amongst zazen quest tears. An olive branch grew in revelation that distinction between us and great animals however lives nourish ever-doused universal bosoms, tides consistently hearkening anew once clashes sift passage through being. Oddball Industries leaves this cacophonous rift more tightly knitted than before as speci(speculative news)-tating Rachel comfortably realizes the magic of a much broader cryptogorillic reality right before the epic brownout caused by plugfarm experiments visited since ages of yonder.
