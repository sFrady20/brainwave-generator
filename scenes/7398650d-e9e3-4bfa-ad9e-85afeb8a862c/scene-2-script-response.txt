>> [15] > 5/5 - Rachel, David, Marcus, Liam, Nia
:: Rachel : exasperated : You guys, I just found out something truly shocking about the eccentric artist who claims Harambe visits her in her dreams! Turns out, she has no actual connection with gorilla society at all! We've been chasing a wild goose here, or should I say, a wild gorilla?
:: David : chuckling : I knew it! I mean, come on, who could really have a connection with gorilla society? What would that even look like? "Hey, buddy, wanna grab a banana and chat about the latest in gorilla politics?"
:: Marcus : dramatically : And just like that, the mighty Harambe bubble is burst! It was a wild, strange, and oddly profound ride, but I suppose all things must come to an end.
:: Liam : smirking : Rachel, my dear, we didn't buy into this for some deep connection to gorilla society. We were just having a bit of fun, embracing the chaos, and bonding with our fellow Oddball family members. It's the journey that matters, not the destination.
:: Nia : nodding : I have to agree with Liam here. It's important for us to let loose every now and then, even if it's over something as absurd as a mythical gorilla whisperer. At the end of the day, we'll look back on this and have a good laugh.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Art, Carmen, Devika
:: Art : chuckling : Seems like the Harambe fever is coming to an end, hmm? I must admit, it was quite entertaining seeing everyone come together like that over something so bizarre.
:: Carmen : grinning : Oh, it was a blast, Art! Sometimes, the weirdest and most unexpected things can bring people closer together. I mean, what other company can say that they bonded over a gorilla-themed office party?
:: Devika : smiling : Yeah, it was wild and crazy, but it actually made me appreciate my coworkers more. Seeing everyone get so passionate and engaged over something so strange just reminds me that we're all a bunch of oddballs. And that's exactly what makes this company so special.
