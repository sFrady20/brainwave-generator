>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, David
:: Liam : animated : You know, David, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm really getting behind this Harambe fun. We should have more events like this around here, don't ya think?
:: David : chuckling : I guess you're right, Liam. It's definitely shaking things up around the office. Plus, who doesn't like goofing off and reminiscing about childhood memes? But let's not forget the true spirit of Harambe.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Rachel, Devika, Marko
:: Rachel : sarcastic : Devika, I must say that your Harambe wisdom is certainly stirring the pot around here. Who knew our dear departed gorilla friend had such a following in the office?
:: Devika : enthusiastic : Oh, Rachel, it's all in the name of fun and nostalgia! I never expected it to go this far, but sometimes you just have to embrace the madness, you know?
:: Marko : laughing : You've got a point, Devika. We're all just here for a good laugh and a chance to break the routine. Speaking of which, I've got a joke for you: Why did the gorilla go to therapy? Because he had a monkey on his back!

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Marcus
:: Art : curious : Marcus, I hear there's quite a buzz around this Harambe thing you've started. What's your endgame, my boy? Do you really think this will help boost morale?
:: Marcus : grinning : Art, my dear friend, sometimes a little chaos is just what the doctor ordered. It brings people together and gives them a much-needed break from the daily grind. Plus, it's all in good fun, and who knows? It might just spark a newfound appreciation for gorillas around here!

>> [1] > 4/4 - Nia, Carmen, Samantha, Rachel
:: Nia : intrigued : I must admit, this whole Harambe mania is certainly entertaining. Strange, but entertaining.
:: Carmen : enthusiastic : I'm all for it! It's a great way to bond with our coworkers and have a good laugh. You know what they say, laughter is the best medicine!
:: Samantha : skeptical : I suppose, but I can't help but feel that this is a bit... ridiculous. A gorilla-themed party? Really?
:: Rachel : smirking : Well, Samantha, it might be ridiculous, but it's also a lot of fun. Besides, it's not every day that you get to see your coworkers go bananas over a meme from years ago!
