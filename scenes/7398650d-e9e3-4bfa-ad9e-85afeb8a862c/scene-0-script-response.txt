>> [5] > 2/3 - Devika, Carmen
:: Devika : animated : Carmen, you won't believe what I just overheard! Apparently, there's this eccentric artist donating a sculpture of our dear Harambe to the local zoo. She even claims Harambe visits her in her dreams! This is incredible, don't you think?
:: Carmen : amused : Dreams, you say? Well, that sounds like quite the artistic inspiration. I mean, who wouldn't want to be visited by the spirit of Harambe?
:: Devika : excited : I'm so fascinated by this! I think I'm going to share some Harambe wisdom with the entire office. It's time we all reconnect with the memory of the great Harambe.

>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Nia, Marcus, David
:: Rachel : checking phone : Why is Devika suddenly flooding the group chat with all this Harambe wisdom? Did I miss something?
:: Nia : chuckling : I'm not quite sure, but it's oddly entertaining. It's bringing back all those internet memes of yesteryear.
:: Marcus : grinning : Ah, Harambe... our sweet, newly-resurrected prince. What a hoot! I'm totally on board with this sudden wave of gorilla wisdom.
:: David : laughing : Not gonna lie, I kinda missed all the Harambe jokes. Guess it's time to unpeel the past and let the bananas hit the fan!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marko, Liam, Samantha, Michael
:: Marko : laughing : Mate, have you seen this? Devika's gone full-on gorilla mode in the group chat. It's bananas!
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, it looks like we're all aboard the Harambe train now. Next stop, Gorilla City!
:: Samantha : sarcastically : Fantastic, just what we needed. More memes and distractions. As if keeping these people in check wasn't enough of a challenge.
:: Michael : joining in : Well, I don't know about y'all, but I for one welcome our gorilla overlord's wisdom. Maybe there's some hidden genius in those memes.

>> [3] > 3/3 - Devika, David, Rachel
:: Devika : proudly : I'm glad I could brighten everyone's day with some Harambe wisdom. I mean, it's important to honor our gorilla king, right?
:: David : playing along : Oh, absolutely! The office could use a bit of Harambe's guiding light. I mean, what's more important than a meme-ified gorilla's sage advice?
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Right, because nothing screams "enlightenment" like a gorilla meme. But hey, if it sparks a bit of fun, who am I to judge?
