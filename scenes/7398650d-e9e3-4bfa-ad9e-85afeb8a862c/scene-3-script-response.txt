>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Liam, Nia, Marcus
:: Rachel : chuckling : I mean, who would have thought our entire office would go ape over a gorilla's wisdom? And now, we are debating the merits of believing in the spirit of Harambe. The things that bring us together, eh?
:: Liam : laughing : Absolutely, Rachel! It's nuts, but that's what makes Oddball Industries so special. We have this uncanny ability to turn the mundane into a fantastic adventure.
:: Nia : smirking : You know, I have to admit, it's been quite an interesting day. You've got to give it to the team - they sure know how to make a potentially dull workday into something that we'll all remember for years to come.
:: Marcus : grinning : Indeed! There's nothing like a little bit of Harambe madness to unite the office in the most unexpected ways! It's like we've unearthed a hidden treasure trove of camaraderie and mutual understanding, thanks to our beloved late primate.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Art, David, Carmen
:: Art : chortling : I must say, I've never seen this office so full of life and energy over a gorilla! It's like we've discovered some sort of secret sauce that brings people together, even in the strangest of ways.
:: David : snickering : You're right, Art! But I think it's also got to do with the characters we have here at Oddball Industries. Give them a bizarre topic to bond over, and they'll turn it into something legendary!
:: Carmen : giggling : Absolutely! It's proof that we all thrive on the oddball spirit that runs through the veins of this company. I'm just grateful to be part of this wacky family!

:: Devika : winking : Marko, who would have thought that my innocent little message about Harambe would turn into such a catalyst for unity and hilarity? We opened a whole can of worms, didn't we?
:: Marko : chuckling : Ah, Devika, it's been a wild ride for sure! I think it's moments like these that truly remind us that we are part of something unique and bizarre, just like the legends of the mighty Harambe himself!
