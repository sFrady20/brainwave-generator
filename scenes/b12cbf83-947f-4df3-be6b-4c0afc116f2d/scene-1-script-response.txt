>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen, Nia
:: Marcus : grinning : So, have we decided who is on the retaliatory hacking team? I vote for David! He seems to have a knack for creating viral memes.
:: David : sarcastically : Thanks for the vote of confidence, Marcus. But I think my experience in creating memes with a certain squirrel might be better suited for another project. Besides, I don't know the first thing about hacking.
:: Carmen : smirking : I don't think any of us do, but that doesn't mean we can't try, right? We just need to find someone who knows how to do it and get them on our side. But first, we need to address this food delivery mix-up. I mean, who ordered 20 pizzas and forgot to get the right toppings?
:: Nia : chuckling : That would be a good question for Liam, our fearless Director of Sales. Anyways, jokes aside, we need to focus on proving our loyalty and finding the traitor, because it seems Art is dead set on catching someone. Let's keep our wits about us and try not to fall into any squirrely traps, shall we?

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Rachel
:: Rachel : hesitantly : Hey Devika, I know you're busy, but any thoughts on the whole leaker situation? Some people are starting to get a bit paranoid, and there's talk of hacking into CNN to retaliate or something.
:: Devika : chuckling : Isn't that a bit extreme? I mean, if we go around hacking CNN, we'll only make ourselves look more guilty. I'd rather not waste my time on something that might just make things worse. My advice? Let's all just stay calm and focus on our work. If there really is a leaker, they'll be found eventually.

>> [6] > 3/3 - Liam, Marcus, Carmen
:: Liam : defensively : Look, I just wanted to get lunch for everyone as a peace offering. It's not my fault someone forgot to include the right toppings! Besides, are we sure we want to hack into CNN? What if we get caught? 
:: Marcus : smirking : Oh, come on, Liam. Where's your sense of adventure? Besides, we wouldn't be hacking anything too serious – just replacing their top headlines with something hilariously absurd yet obviously false. It would be a digital masterpiece!
:: Carmen : amused : I have to admit, that does sound pretty entertaining. But we need to be careful not to make the situation worse. The last thing we need is for everyone's paranoia to go through the roof.
