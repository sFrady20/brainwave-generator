>> [11] > 4/4 - Arthur, Nia, Carmen, Marcus
:: Arthur : yawning : You know, I've always found it fascinating how our little band of oddballs can bounce back from even the most absurd of circumstances. It's as if we thrive in chaos.
:: Nia : amused : That's certainly one way of putting it, Art. We've had our ups and downs, but we always manage to land on our feet, even if it's a bit wobbly at times.
:: Carmen : chuckling : I mean, who wouldn't want to work at a place where you're just as likely to dodge a squirrel attack as you are to get a raise? It's all part of the Oddball charm.
:: Marcus : laughing : Absolutely, Carmen! The unpredictability of our workplace keeps things interesting and reminds us that we can find amusement in even the most serious of situations.

>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Devika, Rachel

:: Devika : thoughtful : It's been a rollercoaster, Nia. I think we've all learned the importance of staying on our toes and embracing the absurdity of our workplace.
:: Rachel : grinning : Yeah, who knew that our office antics would make us internet famous? It's like we've gone viral for all the right reasons!

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, David
:: Devika : focused : I have to admit, David, this newfound popularity has been both a blessing and a curse. We have to be extra careful with our work, but we've also gained quite a reputation.
:: David : nervously : I know what you mean, Devika. I never expected my... uh... meme to blow up the way it did. It's intimidating, but I think we can use this to our advantage at Oddball Industries.
