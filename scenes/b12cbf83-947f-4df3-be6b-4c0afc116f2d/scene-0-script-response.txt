>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Art : flustered : Blast it, Nia! Liam! Get in here right now! I've just stumbled upon a CNN segment that's airing our dirty laundry, revealing our...questionable...business practices! And I've come to the only logical conclusion available - there's a traitor in our midst, spilling secrets like a faucet!
:: Nia : skeptical : Art, are you sure you've got the facts straight? It might not be an inside job. Plus, we've got to be careful about jumping to conclusions and starting a witch hunt. We don't want to create panic in the office.
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, Art, maybe it's just a big misunderstanding, or they're talking about another company with the same name. You know, like that time I accidentally sent our quarterly reports to Oddball Toys.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Liam, Carmen, David
:: Art : determined : Attention everyone! As you may or may not know, we've got a situation on our hands! I'm calling an emergency meeting! If you care about this company, you'll start acting like bloodhounds and sniff out the weasel who's trying to bring us down!
:: David : chuckling : Oof, Art, that sounds like a serious case of betrayal! But what if instead of a weasel, it's a squirrel? You know, the one that keeps sneaking into the office and stealing our snacks? Maybe he's the mastermind behind all of this!
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely, David. It's definitely the squirrel. I bet he's got a little squirrel-sized laptop hidden in his nest, where he sends encrypted emails to the media.
:: Liam : jokingly : And don't forget the mini squirrel-sized coffee cup to keep him awake during his late-night leaking sessions!
:: Nia : firmly : Alright, enough joking around, everyone. We need to get to the bottom of this. Art, maybe you should gather more information before we start pointing fingers. Misguided accusations won't do us any good.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Devika, Marcus, Marko
:: Rachel : gossiping : Can you believe what's going on? Apparently, we've got a traitor in our midst. Art's gone off the deep end! He's convinced that someone's leaking company secrets to CNN.
:: Devika : doubtful : Seriously? That's ridiculous! I can't believe he's jumping to conclusions like that. It could just be a coincidence, or maybe it's just old news that's resurfaced.
:: Marko : half-joking : Or maybe it's that sneaky squirrel everyone keeps talking about! He's been giving me the side-eye lately. I think he's plotting something...
:: Marcus : laughing : A squirrel, you say? Oh, how scandalous. Perhaps it's time we set up a sting operation and expose the furry culprit once and for all!

== In this act, Art Beecham discovers a CNN segment discussing Oddball Industries' questionable business practices and becomes convinced that there's a leaker within the company. He gathers the employees and tries to rally them to find the traitor, but the reactions are mixed, with some finding humor in the situation (such as David attributing the leak to a squirrel). The act sets the stage for an office-wide search for the supposed mole, and the playful banter and absurdity of the suggested culprits contribute to the irreverent tone of the show.
