>> [11] > 3/4 - Art, Nia, Carmen
:: Art : frazzled : I can't believe we've been running around like headless chickens when the answer was right in front of us! I never should've doubted you all!
:: Nia : exasperated : Art, it's alright. We should've been more careful before jumping to conclusions. I guess we were all just paranoid about looking disloyal.
:: Carmen : chuckling : Well, at least we know we're all very committed to Oddball Industries! So committed, in fact, we were ready to throw each other under the bus!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Rachel, Marcus
:: Liam : sheepish : Hey guys, sorry about stepping on the tablet earlier. But look at the bright side, we all got a good laugh and a small dose of internet fame, right?
:: Rachel : teasing : Yeah, Liam, I guess we should thank you for the distraction from the daily grind! Although, I think some people might want to have a serious word with you about their newfound meme status.
:: Marcus : roaring with laughter : You've got a point, Liam! We turned this office upside down, and now the internet knows Oddball Industries as the wackiest workplace on the planet!

>> [20] > 5/6 - David, Devika, Marko, Sam, Mike
:: David : offbeat : You know, I always thought my butt would make a solid meme, but I never dreamed it would happen in the context of a nonexistent internal leak scandal!
:: Devika : amused : You should be proud, David. You've added a whole new level of absurdity to Oddball Industries, and you've definitely caught the internet's attention!
:: Marko : snickering : Mate, your meme has inspired me to up my game. Maybe I'll accidentally make a meme-worthy mistake next time we're in a crazy situation like this.
:: Sam : sarcastic : Yeah, let's not make this a habit, guys. I don't think my nerves can handle another day of panic and chaos like that.
:: Mike : chuckling : Sam's got a point, but at least we all had a good laugh and learned that laughter is the best medicine for office paranoia!

== In this act, it's revealed that the "leaked information" came directly from well-documented past gaffes that were already made public. The employees realize they never had to search for a leaker when Liam accidentally steps on Art's tablet, rewinding the CNN video to reveal the crucial context they overlooked. The act concludes with the characters finding humor in the absurdity of the whole situation, poking fun at each other and their newfound internet fame as they share jokes and off-topic banter. They recognize the importance of laughter in overcoming workplace paranoia, and the internet knows Oddball Industries as the wackiest workplace on the planet.
