title: The Leaky Scandal
exposition: Art Beecham stumbles upon a CNN segment revealing Oddball Industries' questionable business practices and mistakenly believes there's a secret leaker within the company. Art gathers the employees and gives a rallying (yet hilariously misguided) speech, urging everyone to find and dispose of the traitor.

rising action: Panic ensues at Oddball Industries as everyone tries to prove their loyalty while simultaneously pointing fingers at one another. This includes outrunning crazed squirrels, a food delivery mix-up leading to culinary chaos, and trying to hack CNN to release increasingly bizarre statements in retaliation. These antics trigger multiple moments fit for viral meme-worthy quotes and absurd images perfect for reproducing for internet clout.

climax: In a dramatic turn of events, it's revealed that the "leaked information" came directly from well-documented past gaffes that were already made public. The employees realize they never had to search for a leaker, after Liam accidentally trods on Art's tablet, accidentally rewinding the CNN video to reveal this crucial context they overlooked because of their nosy Whatsapp group.

falling action: As the compounding truths dissipate tensions among the characters, focus shifts back to the complexity of the office day-to-day. David becomes world-famous for his meme that bares his butt next to the phrase "This is how under-supported I am", while Sam stays on guard for any inkling of a threat on the employees Twitter accounts.

resolution: In the end, internal squabbles subside and Oddball Industries emerges from its unavoidable ennui—all thanks to bizarre situations, strange disputes, and contrived cecography. Arthur happily resorts to snoring in critical meetings, micro-managing and vague eaves-dropping as leaked professional slips are renewed and free publicity brings Oddball leverage! Even the World Wide Web forgot the company in a wicked unpredictability venturous enough to once again become obscure amongst memetics.
