:: Art : bemused : So, Devika, you reckon you can exorcise this pineapple phenomenon that's swept through our office today, huh? I mean, I've seen some strange things in my time, but this takes the cake, or should I say, pineapple?
:: Nia : smirking : Art, let's not mistake a fruit for a dessert, but I am fascinated to hear Devika's plan on how to resolve this strange occurrence.
:: Devika : confidently : Trust me, guys! I may be a little unconventional, but I've got a foolproof plan to chase away any lingering forces from that mysterious pineapple. It's a mix of science and mystic arts. You'll see!
:: David : chuckling : Oh, speaking of science and mystic arts, Marcus, I saw those photos of you on Tinder with that caption - "the big belly hick benny goo dish ben-box trick!" Man, those sinking crews running from the cops are hilarious! How do you come up with this stuff?

:: Marcus : laughing : David, my friend, you've got to have a wild imagination and a knack for creating absurd situations! And, of course, a little bit of internet inspiration never hurts!
:: Liam : grinning : I've got to admit, this pineapple situation has really brought out the best in our office banter. It's a refreshing break from the usual office monotony.
:: Carmen : smirking : You mean, we finally have a reason to gather in a conference room to discuss something besides sales targets and project deadlines? Count me in! I'm excited to see Devika in action.
