>> [1] > 2/4 - Rachel, Marcus
:: Rachel : puzzled : So, Marcus, have you noticed anything strange going on around the office today? I mean, aside from the whole pineapple situation. There are these odd whispers of pranks, witches cooking up some sort of regular darkness box, and the descent down destiny lanes. Is it just me or is everyone going bonkers?
:: Marcus : chuckling : Ah, Rachel, my dear inquisitive friend. I believe the phantom pineapple has cast a spell of absurdity upon us all. Not only has it brought out our inner jesters, but it seems to be conjuring strange, nonsensical tales that defy all logic. It's almost poetic, like marigold storms and pancakes frying in the eye of some cosmic joke.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Devika, David, Carmen
:: Devika : theatrically : Ah, my fellow Oddballers, gather 'round as I spin a yarn of silver laughter and glass tiles, where gossip and celebratory recovery intermingle in a dance of hilarity. Truly, the remnants of the phantom pineapple's power have turned our once mundane office into a cauldron of chaos and comedy!
:: Carmen : amused : Devika, your words paint a picture as mad and delightful as this day has been. It seems we've found ourselves in a fever dream of laughter and nonsense, but you know what? I kind of like it!
:: David : laughing : Oh, it has been quite the rollercoaster! But in a way, isn't that what makes Oddball Industries so uniquely... odd? In any case, I'm just glad we're all here to enjoy the madness together.

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Liam
:: Art : grinning : Liam, my boy, have you ever seen such a whirlwind of zany antics and red herrings in your time here? I must say, I haven't had this much fun since that time I accidentally spilled a gallon of glue in the break room.
:: Liam : smirking : Art, I have to agree. It's been a wild ride, and I'm starting to think this phantom pineapple might just be the best thing that's happened to our company in a long while! We should have paranormal fruit in the office more often.
