>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Art, Nia, Carmen
:: Rachel : shocked : Can you guys believe this mysterious pineapple just appeared at my desk out of nowhere? And it has this trippy glow around it!
:: Art : amused : Well, Rachel, maybe it's the pinnacle of pineapples, or dare I say, the pine-acle of fruit? *laughs at his own pun*
:: Nia : sarcastically : Fantastic, Art. We're all thrilled by your wordplay. But seriously, Rachel, you're not suggesting there's anything paranormal about a pineapple, are you?
:: Carmen : excited : Oh, come on, Nia! This is the perfect excuse for some office excitement! Let's just roll with it and see where it takes us.

>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Marcus, Liam
:: David : chuckling : So, guys, have you heard about this pineapple that's causing a stir around here? Apparently, it's got some magical powers or something. *laughs hysterically* As if a piece of fruit could do that!
:: Marcus : playfully : Ah, David, never underestimate the power of pineapples! They've been known to be the source of many legendary pranks in office history!
:: Liam : smirking : You know what, I bet it's just another one of Devika's goofball creations. She's always causing chaos around here. Maybe she just found a way to make pineapples glow for no reason, just yanking our chain!

>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, Art
:: Rachel : determined : I need to get to the bottom of this. I'm going to interrogate everybody about this pineapple until I find out the truth!
:: Nia : doubting : Rachel, don't you think you're overreacting a bit? It's just a pineapple, and even if it glows, it's not going to hurt anyone. 
:: Art : grinning : Nia, sometimes, you just have to embrace the absurdity of life. Let Rachel have her fun, and who knows? We might even learn a lesson or two about office witchcraft and telepathy in the process!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Carmen, David, Liam
:: Marcus : jokingly : So, any of you got any past experience with magical pineapple pranks? David, you seem like the type to have dabbled in the mystical fruit arts.
:: David : flattered : Haha, well, I did once try to make a banana levitate using nothing but static electricity and some duct tape. But that's a story for another time.
:: Carmen : grinning : You guys are insane, but I love it! I'd love to see that levitating banana in action, David. Maybe we can add it to our arsenal of office pranks.
:: Liam : smirking : Just wait till we find out the truth behind the Phantom Pineapple – that's going to be the ultimate prank weapon! Office telepathy, here we come!
