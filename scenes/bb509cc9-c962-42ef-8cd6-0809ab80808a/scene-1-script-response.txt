>> [18] > 3/3 - Mike, Sam, Nia
:: Mike : excited : You know, Sam, ever since that pineapple showed up, I've been feeling this strange boost in my, uh, romantic powers. I mean, just look at these adorable magic air particles floating around! 
:: Sam : sarcastically : Oh, really, Mike? How very... interesting. So what are you planning to do with these newfound powers? Serenade me with a love ballad or something?
:: Nia : chuckling : You two sure know how to bring some humor into a bizarre situation. That pineapple sure has everyone acting a little... loopy.
:: Mike : grinning : Oh, Nia, you have no idea! I've been working on this incredible tennis ball hurling technique, and I'm telling you, it's going to blow everyone away during the security-drilled exercise later. You just wait!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Marcus : dramatically : And thus, my dear friends, the great pineapple-induced romance revolution has begun! See how the sparks fly and hearts flutter with accelerated gusto!
:: David : snickering : So, Marcus, you're saying the pineapple is giving us all some sort of romantic superpowers? I don't even want to know what kind of chaos that would create around here.
:: Carmen : amused : This is getting more absurd by the minute. You know what, I'm just going to enjoy my lunch, pineapple or not, and let the mystical rejection and attraction races continue without me.
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, come on, Carmen! Don't you want to be a part of this pineapple-fueled love fest? Who knows, maybe we'll all find our true love in the midst of this juicy chaos!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Devika, Rachel
:: Art : confused : So, you're saying that my office pineapple has become some sort of love-potion-dispensing machine? This is getting a little too bizarre for my taste.
:: Devika : pondering : You know, I have been feeling a bit more... inspired lately. But I'm not sure if it has anything to do with that pineapple. The human mind is a mysterious thing, after all!
:: Rachel : excited : I'm telling you, there's something not right about that pineapple! We need to get to the bottom of this before things spiral even further out of control!
