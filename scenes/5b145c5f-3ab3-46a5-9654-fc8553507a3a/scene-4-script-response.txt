>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Devika, David, Marcus
:: Rachel : plotting : All right, guys, we need to find out who's been editing this footage and creating this whole Phantom Clicker hysteria. I think we should split up and search the office, starting with the computers to see if there's any evidence of video editing.
:: Devika : pragmatic : I'll take the lead on checking the computers, Rachel. It's only logical, considering I work with them the most. We can start by examining the editing software usage history and any recent files that may hold clues.
:: David : excited : I'm in! I mean, I'm probably the last person you'd expect to be good at this kind of detective work, but hey, even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes, right? Plus, I just wanna know who turned my printer calamity into a horror show.
:: Marcus : sarcastic : Oh, David, your endless optimism in the face of your imminent failure is just so... inspiring. Count me in, too. The sooner we can put this absurdity behind us, the better. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually miss the mundane office drama.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Liam
:: Nia : concerned : Carmen, Liam, I need you two to help search the office for any suspicious activity. Look for anything that might give us a clue as to who's behind this whole Phantom Clicker fiasco.
:: Carmen : enthusiastic : You got it, boss! I love a good mystery, and this one's the juiciest I've ever encountered. You think we'll find a hidden lair or evil genius hideout?
:: Liam : joking : Carmen, if we do find a secret lair, I'm claiming it as my new office. I need a space where I can spread my creative wings! You know, a place with better lighting and fewer judgmental glares from my coworkers.

>> [6] > 3/3 - Art, Marko, Samantha
:: Art : chuckling : Ahh, Marko and Sam, you finally found me! I have to admit, watching you all running around like headless chickens was more entertaining than I anticipated.
:: Marko : surprised : Wait, Art, you're behind this whole thing? This Phantom Clicker madness?
:: Samantha : stern : Sir, what was your intention with this... prank? It caused chaos throughout the office.
:: Art : jovially : Samantha, dear, sometimes injecting a little humor into the mundane proceedings of this office is just the ticket to boost creativity and productivity. Plus, it's just plain funny watching everyone go mad with conspiracy theories.

== In this act, the employees split into groups and search the office for the mastermind behind the Phantom Clicker hysteria. Rachel, Devika, David, and Marcus examine the computers, while Nia, Carmen, and Liam search for any suspicious activity.
