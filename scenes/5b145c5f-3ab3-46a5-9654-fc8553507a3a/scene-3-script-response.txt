>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Marcus, Rachel
:: David : panicking : Guys, I swear, my computer is possessed! Every time I try to type something, the words come up scrambled! It's the work of the Phantom Clicker!
:: Marcus : sarcastically : Oh, sure, David. Just like how your coffee spilled on your desk because the Phantom Clicker pushed it, right?
:: Rachel : rolling her eyes : You both need to calm down. We just need to find a way to put an end to this paranoia.

>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Liam
:: Nia : concerned : Liam, the chaos in the office is getting out of hand. Have you come across any bizarre happenings lately?
:: Liam : smirking : Honestly, Nia, I'm convinced the Phantom Clicker is just Art's way of getting us all together to brainstorm some out-of-the-box marketing strategies. Can't beat the power of a good viral villain, am I right?

>> [6] > 3/3 - Rachel, Carmen, Devika
:: Carmen : excited : Alright, team! Welcome to the first meeting of the Oddball Anti-Phantom Clicker Task Force! Rachel, what's our first course of action?
:: Rachel : reasonably : I think we should all re-watch the movie together. Maybe we can find a clue to put an end to this madness. Devika, can you set it up in the conference room?
:: Devika : reluctantly : Sure, I'll give it a shot, but I have a sneaking suspicion the Phantom Clicker might just be someone in the office having a laugh at our expense.

>> [16] > 6/7 - Nia, Liam, Marcus, David, Rachel, Carmen
:: David : gasping : Guys, look at that scene! That looks like our office in the background! What if someone in the office edited these weird happenings into the movie?
:: Rachel : shocked : David, you might actually be onto something! There's no way this is a coincidence. The Phantom Clicker must be one of us.
:: Nia : skeptical : That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think? How can we be sure that someone from our office is behind this?

>> [6] > 3/3 - Rachel, Carmen, Devika
:: Carmen : determined : Rachel, your plan worked! We need to find the person responsible for editing the footage into the movie. Let's start by asking if anyone in the office has any video editing skills.
:: Devika : intrigued : I'll start by checking the computers for any suspicious activity or recently used video editing software. Maybe that will point us in the right direction.
:: Rachel : excited : Great, let's put an end to the Phantom Clicker once and for all!

== In this act, suspicion mounts, and conspiracies run rampant in the office. Rachel forms a task force and they re-watch the movie, discovering that it has been edited with actual employee footage. Devika agrees to investigate the computers and use of video editing software to find the person responsible for the Phantom Clicker hysteria. The employees get closer to the truth as the conspiracy theories thicken. The entire act is full of irreverent humor and whacky character displays, with cartoonishly ridiculous and insane conversations.
