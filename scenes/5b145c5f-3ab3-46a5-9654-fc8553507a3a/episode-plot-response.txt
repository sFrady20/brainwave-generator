title: Nightmare on Oddball Street
exposition: The office is abuzz when Carmen accidentally stumbles upon an old VHS tape from the 90s in the back storage room. It turns out to be a horror movie called 'Phantom Clicker,' where the story involves an internet creature haunting people and eventually absorbing them into their computers. The company holds a bizarre team movie night, where they watch and discuss the strangeness of the cult movie, then resume their day-to-day jobs with unexpected developments.

rising action: Soon after, weird occurrences begin happening around the office, and a misguided dread latches onto the employees. David, being the office klutz, blames several equipment failures and his typos on the 'Phantom Clicker.' Furthermore, anyone who enters the bathroom has never-ending loop of extremely odd topics, keeping people in there unintentionally for long periods to widespread concern.

climax: As the employees and the company deal with the havoc around them, someone dresses as the Phantom Clicker, feeding into their paranoia. All characters experience bizarre issues that put them on edge. Even stoic characters like Mike and Sam join the fray, believing in the Phantom Clicker as a viral villain.

falling action: Suspicion mounts, shifting tension throughout the office. Conspiracy theories start running rampant and slowly, everyone contributes equally obscure viewpoints to explain the mess. Rachel concocts a plan: they will re-watch the movie upon the insistence of conspiracists around the water cooler. Ultimately, Devika notices odd artifacts in the tape indicating that someone from the office has edited actual employee footage into plot points from 'Phantom Clicker,' sparking the conspiracy in the first place.

resolution: Everyone searches together for the real mastermind, realizing that certain chaotic office happenings had simple explanations rooted in regular workplace quirks. Finally, they find Art laughing in the back storage room, revealing that he staged the entire playout to inject comic relief into the workplace during a particularly cliche episode in their business strategy discussions. As they were all victims (or perpetrators) of increasingly hilarious tidbits during the wild turn of events, employees concede defeat to their company visionary, albeit puzzled to his motivations as CEO.
