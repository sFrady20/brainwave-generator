>> [6] > 1/3 - Carmen
:: Carmen : excited : Guys, you won't believe what I just found in the back storage room! It's this old VHS tape from the 90s called 'Phantom Clicker.' I wonder what it's about. There's only one way to find out. We should totally have a team movie night to watch this bad boy.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Nia, David, Rachel
:: Marcus : thrilled : You know what, Carmen? That sounds like an absolutely outrageous idea! I'm always up for a group event surrounded by Oddball comrades. Count me in!
:: Nia : amused : A movie night, huh? Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to take a little break from our daily tasks and bond over some strange 90s flick. Let's do it!
:: David : clumsy : Oooh, a horror movie! I'm not usually the biggest fan of getting spooked, but I can't resist a good group event. Just don't blame me if I accidentally fling my popcorn all over the place out of fear!
:: Rachel : enthusiastic : This is going to be epic! Nothing like watching an internet creature movie to spark some creative brainstorming sessions. I'll bring the snacks!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Liam, Devika, Marko, Carmen
:: Art : intrigued : This 'Phantom Clicker' movie sounds interesting. Who would have thought a cheesy 90s horror film would bring our team together? I'm excited to hear everyone's thoughts on it.
:: Liam : sarcastic : I'm sure this will be a cinematic masterpiece, full of thought-provoking material. Hey, at least we'll be able to laugh at the terrible special effects.
:: Devika : offbeat : I wonder if there are any hidden messages in the movie. You know, like a secret code we need to decipher to unlock the secrets of the universe!
:: Marko : animated : You never know, Devika! We might just learn something from this mysterious VHS tape. Or at the very least, we'll get some good laughs out of it.
:: Carmen : eager : Alright, team! Let's get this movie night started! Remember, if you get too scared, we can always switch to a cat video marathon.

>> [20] > 4/6 - Nia, David, Rachel, Marcus
:: Nia : perplexed : Well, that was certainly... something. Who knew internet creatures could be so terrifying yet hilarious at the same time? I'm not sure if I'll ever look at my computer the same way again.
:: David : shaken : I have to admit, I was not prepared for the sheer absurdity of that movie. I think I'll be double-checking my computer for phantom clickers for weeks!
:: Rachel : amused : If anything, it certainly gave us something to talk about, right? I can't wait to see what other bizarre relics we can find in this office.
:: Marcus : animated : Indeed, my fellow Oddballians! The escapades of the 'Phantom Clicker' may be behind us, but who knows what other peculiar misadventures await us in the depths of our beloved workplace?
