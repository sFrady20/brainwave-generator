>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, David, Rachel
:: Liam : grinning : Well, if it isn't our very own Phantom Clicker suspect! David, my man, you've had quite the morning, haven't you? Care to explain why you've been lurking around the office like a tech-possessed poltergeist?
:: David : defensive : Hey, I'm not the Phantom Clicker! I've just had a string of bad luck today, and it's not my fault that everyone's machines are acting up. It must be something in the air!
:: Rachel : teasing : Sure, David. We all know your clumsiness knows no bounds, but blaming it on the Phantom Clicker? That's a new low, even for you!

>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Devika
:: Nia : concerned : I tell you, something's not right. I was in the bathroom, and it felt like I was being sucked into a black hole of never-ending weird conversations. It's like we're under some sort of curse!
:: Carmen : chuckling : Oh, come on, Nia! It's just a bit of office banter. It's not like there's an actual Phantom Clicker haunting us. But I have to admit, things have been a bit off lately.
:: Devika : intrigued : Curse or not, it's getting a little out of hand. I mean, I've heard of chaotic workplaces, but this is next level!

>> [2] > 2/2 - Marcus, Samantha
:: Marcus : amused : Sam, my dear, have you heard? The office is falling apart, and all because of a silly horror movie! What are your thoughts on this phenomenon?
:: Samantha : stern : Marcus, you know I don't have time for such nonsense. But I have to admit, the absurdity is getting a little hard to ignore. Let's just hope it doesn't escalate further.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Liam, Marko, Rachel
:: Art : chuckling : Well, it looks like my little prank is working even better than I expected! The chaos is quite enjoyable, don't you think?
:: Liam : smirking : Ah, the mastermind behind the mayhem! I had a feeling you were up to something. Brilliant move, Art, brilliant!
:: Marko : confused : Wait, so all this weirdness is your doing, Art? I mean, it's funny and all, but why the chaos?
:: Rachel : joining in : Yeah, Art, you've got us all on edge! What's the end goal here, or is it just for the thrill of it?

== In this act, the office is plagued by bizarre occurrences, and the employees blame their troubles on the "Phantom Clicker" from the movie they watched. David's clumsiness is attributed to the Phantom Clicker, and the bathroom becomes a vortex of strange conversations. As the chaos ensues, it's revealed that Art is behind it all, creating an oddly entertaining atmosphere in the office.
