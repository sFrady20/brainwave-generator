>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Rachel, Marcus
:: Liam : excited : Guys, you won't believe it! I just saw someone dressed as the Phantom Clicker roaming around the office!
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, really, Liam? Are you sure it wasn't just a figment of your ever-so-active imagination?
:: Marcus : dramatic : No, no, my dear Rachel! Liam might just be onto something! The Phantom Clicker has come to life and is out to get us all!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Nia, Devika, David
:: Art : chuckling : And so the plot thickens! Our very own Oddball version of the Phantom Clicker is stirring up some much-needed commotion!
:: Nia : exasperated : Art, please tell me you're not encouraging this madness. We're supposed to be working, not entertaining wild conspiracy theories!
:: Devika : lost in thought : But what if the Phantom Clicker is real, and it's trying to absorb us into the depths of the internet? It could be an AI experiment gone wrong!
:: David : laughing : Oh, come on, Devika! Next thing you know, my spilled coffee will be the result of the Phantom Clicker's nefarious schemes!

>> [20] > 6/6 - Carmen, Marko, Mike, Sam, Liam, Marcus
:: Carmen : hyperbolic : All right, everyone, listen up! It's clear that we're under attack from a supernatural force, so I propose we form an Oddball Anti-Phantom Clicker Task Force!
:: Marko : amused : Oh, Carmen, I can't tell if you're serious, but I love the idea! Who could resist joining such an epic team?
:: Mike : smirking : As ridiculous as it sounds, I'm in. It's not every day I get to investigate a "viral villain."
:: Sam : deadpan : Fine, I'll join, but only to prove that this whole Phantom Clicker thing is nothing more than a wild goose chase.
:: Liam : enthusiastic : Count me in, Carmen! The bigger the group, the easier it'll be to take down the internet menace!
:: Marcus : dramatically : The Oddball Anti-Phantom Clicker Task Force shall reign supreme! Let the great hunt begin!

== The act revolves around the employees dealing with the havoc around them and the paranoia induced by the supposed Phantom Clicker sightings. Even the usually stoic characters, Mike and Sam, are drawn into the chaos. The act is full of edgy, irreverent humor and the characters display exaggerated traits. Carmen forms an Oddball Anti-Phantom Clicker Task Force, and the group embarks on a wild goose chase to bring an end to the viral villain.
