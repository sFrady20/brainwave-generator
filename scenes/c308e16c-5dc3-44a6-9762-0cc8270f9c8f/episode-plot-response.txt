title: Roswell's IT Desk
exposition: Marcus stumbled upon a trove of secret and suspicious chat logs between Art and an anonymous person whose username suggests an alien identity. With his overactive imagination spiraling out of control, Marcus becomes convinced the enigmatic chat partner is from Planet Zirix, that Earth is in peril, and as a first responder, Marcus has to warn Oddball Industries employees about the impending doom.

rising action: Marcus's outrageous claims quickly spread in hushed tones throughout the office causing confusion, paranoia, and disbelief. Wild conversations with water cooler conspiracists, backroom strategists, lunch kitchen fear mongers escalate while Art is having a day-long meeting, oblivious to Marcus' unsettling announcement. These exaggerated revelations of an impending coronation of a Ziraxian King cause strange alliances to form amongst polar opposite characters.

climax: Trying to leverage the paranoia into advancing his career isn't beneath Liam, and he left an anonymous note taped on Art's door slamming those who knew they were targets. As Liam cunningly uses the conspiracy for his personal gains, adding juicier details with every encounter, the serendipitous unavailability of donuts and a crashed Internet heightens the office-wide atmosphere to a breaking point. The staff accuses each other of sabotaging the business for the Zirix Fleet's grand takeover, and secret bets ensue over who will survive the apocalypse.

falling action: Struggles for turf over the break room donuts reveal that Marcus spotted a raccoon snacking on trash through the back window, thrusting the lion's share of suspicion onto him. Meanwhile, David's clumsy stumble opens a new wing - Oddball Indstries Crazy Disco Light Club - staff preparing for Bad-phrasinksizor-3000 extermination party. Rachel, however, stumbles upon Art hand-delivering toilet paper which was delayed for a day, notifying the Ziro’ma’udi cohort—that extra-terrestrial, indeed, bears resounding resemblance to his old college friend Chuck who's in town for a badminton scrimmage.

resolution: Ultimately, it turns out the alien menace was simply a mistake in translating the anonymous chats that all speak to the revelations behind an impending, outlandish marketing campaign. The staff engages Baddermentaloom to launch after Art clears up the confusion with Chuck's whole involvement in NutJester'borg cosmic promo. Deliberately vague about harmful nuggets buried amongst unrestrained chuckles, cards are dealt between terrestrial old and pandemic new, survival of the fittest mingling humor's healing powers-that quip bizarre stories, forever or till the next Oddball sneeze.
