>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Nia, Carmen
:: Marcus : panicked : Listen up, everyone! I saw a raccoon outside snacking on trash, which can only mean one thing - it's a spy sent by the Zirixians to gather intel on us!
:: David : sarcastically : Oh yeah, Marcus, because a raccoon is definitely the most cunning and efficient spy any alien race could send. I mean, those little trash pandas are practically invisible!
:: Nia : dismissive : Marcus, quit being ridiculous. It's just a raccoon. The office is already on edge because of these conspiracy theories, and we don't need any more fuel for the fire.
:: Carmen : laughing : Maybe the raccoon has already infiltrated our systems! Who knows what kind of classified garbage it's digging up? The next thing you know, it'll be snacking on our Wi-Fi password!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, David, Nia, Carmen, Liam
:: David : clumsy : Whoa, what's this? *stumbles into a new room* It looks like Oddball Industries has its own crazy disco light club! Are we hosting an extermination party for Bad-phrasinksizor-3000? And I didn't even get an invite!
:: Liam : scheming : You know, David, maybe we should make this party exclusive. Just think about it - if we only invite the people we trust, we can keep the supposed "alien threat" at bay while we have a blast! Plus, it'll make us look like we're in the know.
:: Nia : annoyed : Liam, that's a terrible idea. We have more important things to worry about, like keeping this company running, rather than playing alien detective and throwing alien-themed parties.
:: Marcus : excited : This is perfect! We need to prepare ourselves for the Zirixian invasion, and what better way to do that than to embrace the chaos and dance like no one's watching?
:: Carmen : grinning : Alright, you know what? Let's do it. Let's have a party before the world ends! I'm ready to embrace this madness and boogie down like there's no tomorrow!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Rachel
:: Rachel : inquisitive : Art, what are you doing with all that toilet paper? Wasn't there a delivery delay?
:: Art : relieved : Ah, Rachel, just in time! Yes, there was a delay, but I managed to secure a last-minute shipment for us. Can't have our staff without proper supplies, now can we?
:: Rachel : surprised : Wait a second. I've seen that symbol on the toilet paper packaging before. Isn't that the same symbol used in the chats with the supposed alien? Is this all just a huge coincidence, or is there something more to it?

>> [18] > 3/3 - Rachel, Marcus, Art
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, you won't believe this! I just saw Art with a bunch of toilet paper bearing that same alien symbol from the chats! What if he's been in contact with them all along, and we've been freaking out for no reason?!
:: Marcus : curious : Or... maybe Art has been playing us all along! That symbol could have been a secret code just waiting to be discovered! 
:: Art : chuckling : You've got it all wrong. That "alien" you think I've been chatting with? It's just my old college buddy Chuck. We used to play badminton together, and he's in town for a scrimmage. I admit the symbol looks odd, but it's just a coincidence. Now, can we get back to work and stop worrying about aliens?

== In this act, the staff's paranoia reaches a breaking point as they bicker over break room donuts, form wild theories over a raccoon sighting, and discuss an impromptu party. David stumbles into a hidden disco-themed room, while Rachel learns Art has a connection to the alleged "alien." Ultimately, it's revealed that Art's mysterious chat partner was just his old college friend Chuck, and the employees' suspicions were completely unfounded. The act is filled with absurd banter, wild conspiracy theories, and tongue-in-cheek humor.
