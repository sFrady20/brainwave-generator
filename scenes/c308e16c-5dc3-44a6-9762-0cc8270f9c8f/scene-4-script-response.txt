>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Marcus, Liam
:: Art : laughing : You know, Marcus, the situation you started with that alien hoax really got everyone on their toes. Now, I'm not mad, I'm actually grateful. It's been a while since we've seen that much energy in the office.
:: Marcus : sheepish : Well, Art, it wasn't my intention to cause panic, but I have to admit, the excitement was contagious. I'm just relieved we were able to clear up the confusion.
:: Liam : smirking : So you're telling me we wouldn't be launching the Baddermentaloom campaign if it weren't for Marcus's wild imagination? That's just too perfect!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Rachel, David, Devika
:: Nia : chuckling : I have to say, I never thought I'd see all you Oddballs banding together like that. You all certainly know how to keep things interesting around here.
:: Rachel : grinning : You should've seen some of those conspiracy theories flying around. Some of them were so crazy, they almost seemed plausible!
:: David : amused : Remember when we thought it was actually Art who was the alien in disguise? That was wild!
:: Devika : smirking : I'm just glad we can all laugh about it now. But seriously, who knew a little mistranslation could cause such chaos?

>> [15] > 5/5 - Carmen, Marko, Sam, Mike, Chuck
:: Carmen : laughing : So, Chuck, I have to ask - what was it like seeing your name associated with this whole alien conspiracy?
:: Chuck : grinning : It was definitely a surprise, but hey, who wouldn't want to be part of such a bizarre and hilarious story? I'm just glad I wasn't abducted or anything!
:: Marko : howling : If I ever write a book about Oddball Industries, this chapter will be called "The Day Chuck Invaded Earth."
:: Sam : rolling her eyes : Alright, it was funny, but let's not forget our jobs. The last thing we need is another intergalactic incident around here.
:: Mike : chuckling : Don't worry, Sam. I don't think there's any chance of that happening anytime soon...unless Marcus stumbles upon another secret chat.
