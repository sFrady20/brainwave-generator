>> [12] > 1/2 - Marcus
:: Marcus : surprised : Oh my Zirix! This conversation between Art and some anonymous alien-looking username... It can't be real, right? But what if it is? What if Earth is in danger, and this Oddball Industries office is Ground Zero? I must dig deeper and warn everyone... before it's too late!

>> [1] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Marcus : frantic : Guys, listen up! I just stumbled upon something unbelievable. You won't believe it, but I think our dear CEO Art has been chatting with someone from Planet Zirix!
:: David : sarcastically : Oh, right. So what's next? Are we gonna be visited by their king or something?
:: Marcus : seriously : That's exactly what I'm worried about!
:: Carmen : amused : Well, I guess there's never a dull moment at Oddball Industries, huh? But seriously, Marcus, try to come back down to planet Earth, would you?
:: Rachel : grinning : Yeah, Marcus. There's more chance of us winning the lottery than Art talking to aliens. Maybe focus on something more realistic, like uncovering the office snack thief.

>> [2] > 2/2 - Marcus, Liam
:: Marcus : whispering : Liam, I discovered something huge. There might be a connection between Art and some extra-terrestrial entity from Planet Zirix! We need to inform the team.
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, really? You don't say! You know what, Marcus? I'll help you spread the word. Let's see who else in this office can be swayed by this thrilling tale from the far reaches of the galaxy!

>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Devika
:: Nia : chuckling : So, Marcus thinks Art is talking to aliens? That's a new level of wild! I almost wish it were true, just for the excitement.
:: Carmen : laughing : It's certainly a break from the routine!
:: Devika : thoughtfully : But what if... what if there's even a tiny chance it's true? I mean, statistically speaking, we can't be the only intelligent life in the universe, right?

>> [6] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Rachel
:: Marcus : conspiratorially : Listen, I know it sounds crazy, but I've found more evidence. These chat logs... they're not just some prank. We need to prepare for the impending doom!
:: David : rolling eyes : Marcus, it's like you're trying to win the office conspiracy theory award. Look, if Art's talking to aliens, I'll eat my tie.
:: Rachel : playfully : Can I hold you to that, David? I'd love to see that happen. But anyway, Marcus, even if it is true, what can we really do? We're just an IT company. We don't have the means to fight off an alien invasion.

== In this act, Marcus discovers chat logs that make him believe Art is in contact with an alien from Planet Zirix. Despite the wild and ridiculous nature of his claims, he earnestly tries to warn his coworkers about the impending doom. His coworkers, however, are skeptical and make light of his conspiracy theory, turning the situation into a running joke around the office. As Marcus's message begins to spread, the office atmosphere becomes more tense and paranoid, with even the most level-headed employees starting to question what might be true.
