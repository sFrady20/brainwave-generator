>> [1] > 3/4 - Liam, Rachel, Carmen
:: Liam : smirking : You know, the more Marcus talks about these alien invasions, the more I think there just might be something to it. I mean, donuts don't just disappear, and the internet doesn't just crash for no reason. I think there's a chance this could be big. Big enough to give me the career boost I've been looking for.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, so you're going to save the world by exposing the Zirix Fleet and get that promotion you've always wanted? I can see the headlines now: "Liam O'Connell, World Savior and Corporate Climber."
:: Carmen : chuckling : Well, if the world's going to end, we might as well have a little fun along the way, right? I mean, placing bets on who's going to survive the apocalypse? Kind of morbid, but it's also kind of hilarious.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Devika, Marcus
:: Nia : skeptical : So let me get this straight, Marcus. You found some chat logs with an "alien" and you think it's end times? Don't you think you're blowing this a little out of proportion?
:: Marcus : defensive : You don't understand, Nia. The signs are all there! The missing donuts, the crashed internet... this is just the beginning. We need to prepare ourselves for the Zirix Fleet's takeover! Besides, it's not like anything exciting ever happens around here. We could use a little chaos, right?
:: David : snickering : Well, if you're right, I hope they at least have good taste in memes. Can't have an alien invasion without the best of the internet, am I right?
:: Devika : laughing : At this point, I'm more worried about the office gossip than any alien invasion. Let's just enjoy the silliness while it lasts.

>> [15] > 4/5 - Liam, Rachel, Art, Carmen
:: Liam : conspiratorially : Look, I just think we need to keep our eyes open for any more suspicious activity. If we can figure out who's behind all this, maybe we can turn it to our advantage.
:: Rachel : rolling her eyes : Sure, Liam. As if this whole thing isn't ridiculous enough already. But hey, if it means a chance to stir up some trouble and have a little fun, count me in.
:: Art : confused : Wait, what's going on? Why is everyone talking about aliens and conspiracies? Did I miss something important?
:: Carmen : giggling : Oh, Art. You have no idea. Just another day in Oddball Industries.

== Liam tries to leverage the paranoia for his personal gain by leaving an anonymous note on Art's door and spreading juicier details about the alleged conspiracy. The tense atmosphere in the office escalates with the disappearance of donuts and a crashed internet, as staff accuse each other of sabotage. Characters like Art remain oblivious, while others revel in the chaos, placing secret bets on who will survive the supposed apocalypse. The act is filled with irreverent banter, and characters display their cartoonish ridiculousness in the face of an absurd situation.
