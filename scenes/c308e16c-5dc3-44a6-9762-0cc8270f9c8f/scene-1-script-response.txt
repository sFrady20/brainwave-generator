>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, Nia
:: Liam : conspiratorially : Nia, have you heard Marcus's wild theory about Art being in contact with an alien from Planet Zirix? It's absolutely bonkers!
:: Nia : amused : Oh, Liam. Marcus's imagination is running wild again, huh? I don't believe a word of it, but you have to admit, it spices things up around here.

>> [11] > 3/4 - David, Carmen, Rachel
:: David : nervously : I don't know about you guys, but Marcus's alien story is kind of freaking me out. What if there's even a tiny chance it's true?
:: Carmen : grinning : Oh, come on, David. It's just another one of Marcus's wild ideas. It's funny, though. I might get some popcorn and watch the drama unfold.
:: Rachel : laughing : No need for popcorn, Carmen. My desk is front row seats to all the action. Think of all the gossip potential!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Devika, Marcus, Samantha
:: Devika : intrigued : So, Marcus, who's this alien from Planet Zirix you're so sure Art is talking to? Is it a green little man, or are we more in the, uh, tentacle territory?
:: Marcus : defensively : I'm serious, Devika! I mean, I can't be the only one who thinks something's off here, right?
:: Samantha : smirking : Yeah, Marcus, the only thing off here is you. Aliens, really? We've got security issues to deal with, and you're chasing little green men.

>> [17] > 2/2 - Mike, Marko
:: Mike : chuckling : So, Marko, are you ready to welcome our new Ziraxian overlords? I can't wait to see Art's college pal Chuck reveal himself as an intergalactic badminton champion!
:: Marko : laughing : Mate, if that's what the Zirixians look like, we've got nothing to worry about. I bet Art and Chuck are just having a good chuckle at our expense.

== Marcus's outrageous claims continue to spread throughout the office, causing confusion, paranoia, and disbelief. Wild conversations escalate, and Art remains oblivious to the unfolding chaos in the office. Strange alliances form amongst the employees, who relish the opportunity to revel in the absurdity of the situation, despite their initial skepticism.
