>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Rachel
:: Marcus : chuckling : My word, David, you certainly know how to create quite the stir around the office! This Duckpocalyse has reached peak hilarity! Is it true that you found a flock of rubber duckies floating in the break room sink?
:: David : grinning : Yes, Marcus, I did! I don't know who put those there, but it's brilliant! This whole Duckpocalypse thing has really taken a life of its own. It's like one giant game of 'telephone' gone horribly right!
:: Rachel : snickering : You mean to tell me I need to prepare my rubber ducky defense tactics? Oh, the horror! Oddball Industries is no match for these quacky adversaries! We're all doomed!

>> [14] > 2/2 - Liam, Carmen
:: Liam : smirking : So, Carmen, should we be concerned about the sudden onset of duck-mania? Our office has truly become a ducky dystopia! Can you imagine if we had to swap our desks for duck ponds?
:: Carmen : laughing : Liam, I think I'd suit the role of a pond-side professional quite nicely! Although, I must say, it'd be difficult to operate a computer while floating around on a lily pad. This whole Duckpocalypse ordeal is so absurd, but it's such a refreshing break from the norm!

>> [21] > 2/2 - Michael "Mike" Jackson, Samantha "Sam" Wilson
:: Mike : scratching his head : "Sam, I think I made a bit of a blunder here. I was supposed to run some training simulations today, but with the recent Duckpocalypse craze, I decided to have some fun with it. I had no idea it would cause this level of chaos."
:: Sam : frowning : "You're the one behind all this quackery?! Mike, I can't even walk through the halls without being bombarded by duck memes and chat about quack conspiracies! How are we going to fix this fowl mess?"

== In this act, it's revealed that Michael "Mike" Jackson misunderstood something about security system tests, and he masked them as convincing Duckpocalypse coincidences. The chaos continues to build as other staff members add their own duck-related actions, gadgets, and quips into the mix, resulting in even more absurd hilarity. As Mike reveals the truth to Sam and they ponder how to fix the situation, the office remains in a state of near pandemonium.
