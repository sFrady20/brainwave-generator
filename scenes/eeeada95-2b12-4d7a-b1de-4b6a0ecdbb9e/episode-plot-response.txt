title: Enter the Duckpocalypse
exposition: During a completely ordinary day at Oddball Industries, David stumbles upon a ridiculous internet meme about an upcoming Duckpocalypse. Intrigued and amused, he sets off to convince the entire office that they need to prepare for such an absurd doomsday scenario. As he spreads the word about this meme, it morphs into a viral inside joke amongst the coworkers.

rising action: This seemingly harmless joke starts spiraling out of control when, through a mix of bizarre incidents and improbable coincidences, signs of duck-themed chaos begin appearing throughout the office (such as finding rubber duck toys jammed in odd locations, the sound of ducks quacking inexplicably echoing through the halls, and someone playing a projector presentation featuring tons of duck-related content). The reactions throughout the office range from hilarious disbelief and surprise to genuine concern and even alarm.

climax: Confronted by various characters trying to rationalize the situation at odd locations within Oddball Industries, Art gets hit by David's infectious jest and takes the statement 'if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck' too close to heart. In his delusion, he suspends ongoing operations in anticipation of the forthcoming Duckpocalypse which ultimately leads to countless disruptions throughout the entire company.

falling action: It turns out Michael "Mike" Jackson misunderstood something in his training manual and actuates security system tests he masked, for educational reasons, as convincing Duckpocalypse coincidences. This was only exacerbated as staff members began feeding into the hype with duck-related actions of their own—passionate chatter and coincidently-themed gadgets carry the office to even greater absurd hilarity. 

resolution: As Art soon discovers that it was all a chain of comical mix-ups and mistakes, the employees must band together to attenuate the duck madness nationwide - this includes explaining their series of misinterpretations and convincing others the Duckpocalypse is nothing more than a hoax. At the end of the day, although the company culture spiraled completely out of control, Oddball Industries learned to take the occasional absurd incident in stride, accepting that memes and their unintended consequences can foster some of the wildest viral office stories ever (only to be challenged at the next occurrence of silliness and pranks).
