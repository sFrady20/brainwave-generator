>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Carmen, Nia, Rachel
:: David : excited : Guys, you won't believe what I found in the kitchen! A rubber duck jammed inside the microwave! The Duckpocalypse is really happening! I told you all it was coming, and now the signs are everywhere!
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, come on, David. You really believe that nonsense? It's probably just someone playing a prank, feeding into this whole Duckpocalypse thing.
:: Nia : amused : I must admit, though, it does add a bit of excitement to our mundane office life. Perhaps it's just the universe's way of telling us we need to lighten up and have a little more fun at work.
:: Rachel : concerned : But what if, by some bizarre turn of events, it's actually true? I mean, improbable, yes, but why else would there be ducks appearing all over the place? What if we're all in some kind of duck-themed Twilight Zone?

>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Marcus, Devika
:: Liam : grinning : Marcus, mate, did you hear that weird quacking sound earlier? I swear I thought I saw a duck waddle by my cubicle!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh, Liam, my friend, I fear the Duckpocalypse fever has caught up with you too! We must keep our wits about us, for we know not when the quacking menace will strike next!
:: Devika : sarcastically : Oh, come on, you two. It's obviously just someone messing around. But I must say, it's a nice little distraction from the daily grind.

>> [20] > 6/6 - Art, David, Carmen, Nia, Rachel, Liam
:: Art : concerned : Alright, everyone, gather around. We need to discuss this Duckpocalypse situation. We can't let it spiral out of control and disrupt our work.
:: David : grinning : See! I knew it was real! Art, I told you this Duckpocalypse was coming, and now even you can see the signs!
:: Carmen : rolling_eyes : David, for the last time, it's just a joke! Someone's pulling a prank on us, and it seems to be working.
:: Nia : smiling : I have to agree with Carmen. We should just enjoy the silliness and not let it distract us from our work. After all, laughter is a great stress reliever!
:: Rachel : pondering : But what if... what if it's not just some silly prank? What if this Duckpocalypse is a message from the universe, warning us about something bigger and more dangerous? Maybe we're meant to learn something from all this!
:: Liam : chuckling : Oh, Rachel, you're just as lost in this as David! Let's just enjoy the show and get back to work.
