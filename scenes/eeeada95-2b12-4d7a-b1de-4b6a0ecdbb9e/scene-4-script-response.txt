>> [18] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, David
:: Art : exasperated : Nia, David, I just found out the truth behind this Duckpocalypse fiasco! It appears our good security guard Mike has been running security tests that he disguised as duck-related chaos. And with everyone else jumping on the bandwagon, our office has turned into a looney bin!
:: Nia : astonished : You're kidding, right? All this duck madness was just a security test gone wrong? I can't say I saw that one coming.
:: David : laughing : Well, that's the beauty of internet memes, isn't it? They can take on a life of their own, and before you know it, everyone's quacking up!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, Rachel, Liam, Carmen, Devika
:: Marcus : chuckling : Alright, so let me get this straight. We've been sent into a frenzy over a meme, a few misplaced rubber ducks, and some wacky coincidences? That's golden! I mean, I'm just glad it wasn't a real apocalypse, but still, it's a little eggscruciating!
:: Rachel : smirking : Eggscruciating, Marcus? The puns just don't stop with you, do they? Anyway, I see Art, Nia, and David are in on the truth now. We should start putting an end to this chaos and explain the situation to everyone else.
:: Liam : agreeing : Yeah, we'll have to quack down on this duck mania and get back to work. Wow, I'm starting to talk like Marcus now.
:: Carmen : amused : Hey, at least we've had a good laugh out of it all, right? If anything, this has been one of the most memorable days at work. Imagine the stories we'll be able to tell!
:: Devika : pondering : Yes, but let's make sure we don't let internet culture take over the office again. One Duckpocalypse is enough for a lifetime!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Mike, Sam
:: Art : stern : Mike, I appreciate your dedication to testing our security system, but next time, please leave the ducks out of it. We had the entire office in hysterics over this Duckpocalypse business.
:: Mike : apologetic : I'm really sorry, Art. I didn't mean for it to get so out of hand. I thought it would be a fun way to test our security without anyone getting suspicious.
:: Sam : nodding : And as much as I hate to admit it, I panicked too over some of these duck-related incidents. It's been a wild day, that's for sure. We promise to keep any future security tests more, well, professional.

== In this act, the truth about the Duckpocalypse being a series of security tests carried out by Mike comes to light. Art discovers the truth and shares it with Nia and David, while Marcus and the others also learn about the real cause behind the duck-related chaos. With a mix of amusement and disbelief, the employees of Oddball Industries agree to put an end to the Duckpocalypse and return to normalcy, but not before having a good laugh about the absurdity of their meme-fueled adventure.
