== During an ordinary day at Oddball Industries, David stumbles upon the ridiculous Duckpocalypse internet meme and decides to spread the word throughout the office. He starts by telling Liam, who finds it amusing and joins in. They move on to convince Carmen, Nia, and Rachel, who are also won over by the absurdity of the meme. Finally, they bring Marcus and Devika on board, who both find the idea hilarious and are eager to be a part of the hilarity. The Duckpocalypse soon becomes a viral inside joke among the coworkers.
