>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, David
:: Art : bewildered : David, could you explain to me what's going on? I hear quacking, I see rubber ducks, and I feel like I'm living in some kind of bizarre duck-infested nightmare!
:: David : excited : Art, I've been trying to tell everyone! It's the Duckpocalypse! It started as a joke, but now it's become real! Look around you, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck! The meme has come to life, and we're all in the middle of it!
:: Art : contemplative : Hmm, I see what you're getting at. This is chaos, but perhaps there's some truth to it. Alright, let's suspend operations and prepare for the Duckpocalypse!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Carmen, Marcus
:: Nia : concerned : Art just suspended operations because of this Duckpocalypse madness? I thought it was just a joke!
:: Liam : laughing : Oh, it was, but it's become way more than that now. This place has gone quackers!
:: Carmen : amused : I can't believe we're shutting down over a meme. This is getting out of hand!
:: Marcus : grinning : Well, they do say life imitates art...or in this case, art imitates a meme about ducks! The whole office has become a pond of absurdity.

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Rachel
:: Devika : frustrated : I can't believe Art bought into this Duckpocalypse nonsense! How am I supposed to work on my projects with all these interruptions?
:: Rachel : mischievous : Oh, come on, Devika. Lighten up! It's not every day that we get to witness such an entertaining Duckpocalypse!

>> [14] > 2/2 - Liam, Marko
:: Liam : smirking : Marko, how are you holding up with this Duckpocalypse situation? Looks like Art's joined the pond party.
:: Marko : chuckling : Mate, it's bonkers, and I love it! Can't believe all these quacking coincidences turned the office upside down. But hey, I've always been a fan of ducks, so I'm not complaining!

== The entire office succumbs to the Duckpocalyse madness as Art suspends operations in anticipation of the forthcoming Duckpocalypse. Various characters throughout the office offer their take on the situation, with some characters embracing the chaos while others express frustration at the interruptions caused by the meme-turned-reality. As the act draws to a close, the entire company is now disrupted, teetering on the edge of complete pandemonium as the Duckpocalypse continues to unfold.
