>> [2] > 2/2 - Marcus, Liam
:: Marcus : perplexed : Liam, mate, I couldn't help but overhear you talking about some hypnosis experiment going on at the office. What's that all about? Another crazy idea from your endless supply of tall tales?
:: Liam : grinning : Oh, Marcus, you're not going to believe it, but it's all true. Art got this wild idea of controlling the employees through hypnosis. I mean, it's supposed to be harmless, but who knows how it could turn out?
:: Marcus : smirking : Well, that sounds like a recipe for disaster, or at the very least, a fantastic source of entertainment for the rest of us. Let's see how this unfolds, shall we?

:: Carmen : giggling : I'm in! Let's start roleplaying some hilarious hypnosis scenarios to spice up this mundane day.
:: Marko : animatedly : Okay, how about this? I'm hypnotized to believe Frank, my goldfish, needs to join me in a major office snorkeling trip!
:: Rachel : laughing : Oh my god, that's perfect! And I'll pretend that I'm hypnotized to speak only in cryptic riddles. Good luck getting any actual work done!

>> [4] > 2/3 - Nia, Devika
:: Nia : puzzled : Devika, have you heard about this ludicrous hypnosis rumor going around? I mean, the absurdity of it is just... I can't even.
:: Devika : grinning : Yeah, Nia, I've heard. But hey, it makes the day more interesting, right? So let's embrace the chaos and share our own weird hypnosis tales.
:: Nia : chuckling : Alright, let's give it a go. I'm now so hypnotized that I constantly use bizarre business jargon that makes absolutely no sense. I'll be talking about synergizing our core competencies while realigning our paradigm shifts!
:: Devika : laughing : Oh, Nia, you'll leave everyone completely baffled! This is going to be one unforgettable day at Oddball Industries.
