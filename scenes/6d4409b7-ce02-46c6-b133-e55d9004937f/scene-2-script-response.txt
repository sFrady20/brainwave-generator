>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, Nia, Devika
:: Marcus : overly dramatic : It is finally upon us, comrades! The grandest hypnosis experiment known to mankind! Today, we shall defy logic and reason by bending our very minds to the will of our fearless leader!
:: Nia : sarcastically : Oh, Marcus. You really know how to sell the absurd, don't you? Just be careful not to dive in too deep, lest you find yourself in a world of pure imagination.
:: Devika : chuckling : I have to admit, watching everyone's reactions to this wild rumor is quite entertaining. Perhaps we should start a betting pool to see who goes the furthest down the rabbit hole?

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Marko, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : whispering : Guys, I heard that Art's hypnosis experiment is so effective, you can actually feel yourself floating in mid-air while working! No need for those expensive stand-up desks anymore, am I right?
:: Marko : grinning : Crikey! I've always fancied myself as a bit of a magician. What if I now possess the power to conjure up an army of Frank-clones to do my bidding? How good would that be?
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, I think I can top that. What if I'm so hypnotized that I finally arrive to work early, and the building isn't even open yet? That would make for a great Oddball tale, wouldn't it?
:: Liam : smirking : I don't know about you all, but I feel like I've suddenly gained the ability to close sales deals telepathically. Watch out, world – Liam the Mind-bender is here!

>> [5] > 3/3 - Arthur, David, Samantha
:: Arthur : paranoid : I didn't expect things to spiral so much out of control. We need to put an end to this before our superiors think we're running an asylum over here.
:: David : nervously laughing : Well, Art, I've heard that laughter is the best medicine. Maybe we could all use a good dose of silliness in our lives?
:: Samantha : deadpan : You want to put an end to this madness? I suggest you try hypnotizing everyone again and command them to forget everything that happened. It's worth a shot, right?
