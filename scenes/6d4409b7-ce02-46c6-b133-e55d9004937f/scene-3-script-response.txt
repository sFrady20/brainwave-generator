>> [17] > 2/2 - Marcus, Art
:: Marcus : dramatically : And now, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you my finest rendition of Pavarotti's Nessun Dorma... Let the hypnotic effects commence!
:: Art : alarmed : Marcus, what on Earth are you—wait, hold on. This has gotten way out of hand. I'm putting an end to this hypnosis chaos once and for all.
:: Marcus : feigning surprise : Hypnosis chaos, you say? Art, whatever could you be referring to? My good man, I'm simply giving the performance of a lifetime, all in the name of productivity, of course!

>> [6] > 3/3 - Liam, Devika, Art
:: Art : determined : Liam, Devika, I need you both on board with this. It's time to take drastic measures. We're going to need a tri-forklift lift launch.
:: Liam : smirking : Well, Art, I'm all for doubling down on ridiculousness, and honestly, the idea of a tri-forklift launch sounds like it's just the right level of absurdity to save the day.
:: Devika : amused : I'm in, Art. This has been one of the wildest days in Oddball Industries' history, and I can't wait to see how it all ends.

>> [10] > 3/3 - Marcus, Liam, Devika
:: Marcus : overly dramatic : Ah, my dear audience, prepare for the grand finale of this hypnotic extravaganza! As a legendary singer sings his last note, we shall ascend into a tri-forklift heaven, leaving the earthbound chaos behind!
:: Liam : grinning : Marcus, my good friend, you've really outdone yourself this time. I can't wait to see what kind of mesmerizing chaos this tri-forklift lift launch will bring!
:: Devika : laughing : Well, if nothing else, it's sure to be a memorable day in the annals of Oddball Industries. Let the tri-forklift lift launch begin!

== In this act, Art intervenes between Marcus' Pavarotti performance near the printer and enlists Liam and Devika for an impromptu tri-forklift lift launch at the garage site to halt the hypnosis rumor madness. The plan, while absurd in its nature, sounds just like the thing to bring the office back to reality. With Marcus, Liam, and Devika on board, the climax of the chaotic hypnosis day approaches, and Oddball Industries braces itself for the grand finale of this hypnotic extravaganza.
