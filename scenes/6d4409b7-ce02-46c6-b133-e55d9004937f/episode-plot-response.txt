title: Mind Control Catastrophe
exposition: Art Beecham, during lunch in the private break room, overhears a news report about a supposedly new and effective way of controlling employees through hypnosis. Seeing no harm in following up on this lead, he calls in Liam O'Connell and Devika Sharma to help him concoct a trial-run hypnosis scheme.

rising action: Unbeknownst to Art, hypnosis fails miserably but ends up becoming the office rumor for the day. While at the water cooler, Marcus overhears Liam discussing the hypnosis trial, thinking it's just another one of Liam's outrageous fabrications. In the lunch kitchen, Marko, Rachel and Carmen initiate hilarious roleplaying attempts to exploit the rumor further. The absurd hypnosis rumor spreads like wildfire across the company, taking off with Frank the goldfish joining a major snorkeling attempt and Nia overheard using even weirder business jargon.

climax: The messed-up rumor gains full steam: each employee becomes more and more ridiculous in their antics to challenge their work environment principles supposedly under hypnosis, pushing Oddball Industries to appear absolutely ludicrous by Art's superiors. 

falling action: In an attempt to salvage the record-breaking descent into disarray and halt the whole bizarre office rumor, Art intervenes between Marcus' performance of singing like Pavarotti next to the printer, dragging Liam and Devika into an impromptu tri-forklift lift launch at the garage site. 

resolution: Eventually, Art gathers everyone in the conference room and confesses the embarrassing truth about his hypnosis plot. As the employees finally realize the source of the chaos, the Oddball Industries staff share some hearty laughs over their silliest attempts in and out of 'mere hypnosis'. They agree to keep their wild extravaganza a blood-pact secret shared between the crazy family they've become in light of their experimental disaster, proving legend that it was indeed so memorable, even a little post-hypnotic gold-appetizer would caution away.
