>> [16] > 7/7 - Art, Nia, Liam, Devika, Marcus, Carmen, Rachel
:: Art : slightly embarrassed : Alright, everyone, I've gathered you here to come clean about something I tried to do for the company. It's a bit embarrassing, but I need to set the record straight. You see, I overheard a news report about hypnosis as a way to increase productivity and, well, I thought it would be worth a try. I never imagined it would spiral into this kind of chaos!
:: Nia : smirking : Oh, Art, really? Hypnosis? I mean, I've heard of thinking outside the box, but this is just... next level.
:: Liam : grinning : I've got to admit, Boss, this whole hypnosis fiasco has been one of the most memorable days at Oddball Industries. Can't say it was effective, but it sure was entertaining!
:: Devika : chuckling : You know, I've heard that hypnosis might work on some people, but I think we can all agree that it's not for us. We seem to have a bit too much... creativity... for that kind of thing.
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh, trust me, Art! If you call my Pavarotti performance a result of hypnosis, then I'm the king of the world! But seriously though, thanks for the laughs!
:: Carmen : amused : I've never seen so much silliness in one day. It's been a rollercoaster of absurdity, but I think we can all agree that our team is stronger than ever! And hey, who knew that a little hypnosis—or lack thereof—could have such a profound effect on our camaraderie?
:: Rachel : grinning : Okay, so we all agree not to speak of this day outside of this room? Blood pact? I swear, if I find out that this reaches the higher-ups, I'll unleash my own brand of hypnosis on the traitor!

>> [20] > 4/6 - Liam, Marcus, Carmen, Nia
:: Liam : chuckling : Well, that was quite the adventure, wasn't it? I'm glad we're all on the same page now. Let's just get back to work and forget this ever happened.
:: Marcus : smirking : Forget? Liam, my good man, this will go down in Oddball Industries history! It's the stuff legends are made of! I, for one, will cherish this bizarre day!
:: Carmen : playfully : Agreed! It's been a wild ride, but we all came out stronger and more united than ever. Plus, we now have a hilarious secret to share among ourselves. And who doesn't love a good secret?
:: Nia : smiling : True, but let's try to focus on our work now, folks. We've had our fun, but we still have a business to run. We'll just have to find other ways to keep things interesting around here, but no more hypnosis experiments, alright, Art?

== In this act, Art finally gathers everyone in the conference room and confesses the embarrassing truth about his hypnosis plot, putting an end to the chaos. As the employees finally realize the source of the mess, they share some hearty laughs over their silliest attempts in and out of 'hypnosis'. They agree to keep their wild extravaganza a blood-pact secret shared between the crazy family they've become, proving legend that it was indeed so memorable, even a little post-hypnotic gold-appetizer would caution away. Oddball Industries moves on, a stronger and more united team.
