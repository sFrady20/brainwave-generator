>> [15] > 3/5 - Art, Liam, Devika
:: Art : excited : You know what, guys? I was just having lunch and I overheard this news report about a groundbreaking way of controlling employees through hypnosis. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't want to turn our dear Oddballs into mindless drones, but it got me thinking. What if we could use it to improve productivity?
:: Liam : smirking : Art, I've got to hand it to you, that's one of the most outlandish ideas I've ever heard. But hey, what's life without a bit of madness, right? If you're asking me to help you cook up some hypnosis shenanigans, count me in.
:: Devika : skeptical : I'm not so sure about this, guys. Hypnosis? Really? That's the stuff of tacky stage shows, not a professional workplace. But I guess, as long as harmless fun is our primary goal, I'm game.
>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Liam
:: Art : confident : Alright, Liam. We need to come up with a hypnosis trial that seems convincing enough, but first, we must do some research. Let's hit the internet and find out how this hypnosis thing actually works.
:: Liam : grinning : You got it, boss! Let's dive into the weird world of mind control and see what treasures we can unearth. Just imagine the possibilities! But, uh, let's not get too carried away, eh? We don't want Oddball Industries turning into some kind of mad scientist's laboratory!
>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Art
:: Art : enthusiastic : Devika, I need you to come up with some innovative ways to implement our hypnosis trial. It's going to be a fun experiment, but let's keep it ethical and harmless. We want to test it on our folks without causing any distress.
:: Devika : reluctantly : Fine, I'll give it a shot. But I still think this idea is nuts. Anyway, I'll do some brainstorming and see what I can come up with. Just, you know, try not to get too carried away with this whole hypnosis business. It's all fun and games until someone clucks like a chicken during a board meeting.
== Art overhears a news report about hypnosis and decides to conduct a trial run at Oddball Industries. With Liam and Devika's help, they start researching and brainstorming ideas about how to execute their plan, while making sure it remains harmless and fun for their employees. However, they are all quite skeptical about the effectiveness of hypnosis, and whether it will actually change anything in the workplace.
