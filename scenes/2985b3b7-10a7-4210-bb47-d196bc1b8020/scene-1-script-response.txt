>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, David
:: Nia : puzzled : I don't know about you guys, but I've been noticing some really weird stuff happening around the office. Like, just now, I thought I saw the ghost of our company's founder floating down the hallway.
:: Carmen : excited : Oh my gosh, I saw that too! I thought I was going crazy! You know, I also found a creepy old doll in the supply closet that looks like it's from that old viral video... you know, the one with the creepy music and the spinning head?
:: David : chuckling : You guys are going to think I'm nuts, but I swear, in the elevator earlier, there was a brief moment where I was having a meeting with some inter-dimensional beings. They seemed nice though!

>> [4] > 3/3 - Rachel, Devika, Samantha
:: Rachel : astonished : Guys, I don't know what's happening, but there's a picture of a long-dead CEO in my desk drawer that keeps switching between black and white and color. It's giving me the creeps!
:: Devika : intrigued : Rachel, I've been experiencing strange things too. Random objects on my desk keep triggering memories of internet-spawned folklore like Slenderman and the blue dress or was it the gold dress? I don't even know anymore.
:: Samantha : deadpan : Well, all I know is that something's definitely up. My fear of cats has somehow worsened, and now I can't even look at a picture of a cat on someone's phone without panicking.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Marcus, Art, Marko
:: Liam : bemused : So, you're telling me that everyone in the office is experiencing these bizarre paranormal events? I guess that explains why I keep meeting the ghosts of former sales directors in the stairwell.
:: Marcus : laughing : Liam, you always seem to find a way to one-up everyone's stories. But seriously, I found my computer screen filled with ancient hieroglyphics that seemed to be predicting my every move today. It's mind-blowing!
:: Art : concerned : I've been running this company for over 40 years, and I've never seen anything like this. I don't know whether to be fascinated or terrified, but we need to get to the bottom of it before it ruins our productivity.
:: Marko : grinning : Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm having a blast with all these strange happenings. It's like we're living in our very own internet meme come to life!
