>> [16] > 6/7 - Art, Rachel, Nia, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Art : nervously : Alright everyone, gather around. We need to discuss the paranormal activities happening in our office. I mean, I like a good art installation as much as the next guy, but a glowing abyss as a conference room door? That's a bit too avant-garde even for me.
:: Rachel : sheepishly : Um, Art? I think I might be responsible for this mess. I accidentally introduced a supernatural eternal chain meme to the office communication channels, and I think it's causing all these strange happenings.
:: Nia : astonished : Rachel, are you saying that we're being haunted by a meme? That's so absurd, it's almost brilliant!
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, it's like our office has been turned into a live-action internet fever dream. I can't believe we're about to hold a meeting on paranormal memes!
:: Carmen : excitedly : I know, right? It's like we're in the middle of some wacky internet conspiracy theory. But seriously, we need to find a way to get rid of this supernatural chain meme before things get even more out of hand.
:: Marcus : dramatically : Indeed, we must band together and overthrow this digital menace! It may have brought us some laughs, and I'll admit, some solid spooks, but it's time for us to reclaim our office from the clutches of this paranormal prankster!

>> [11] > 3/4 - Liam, Marko, Devika
:: Liam : smirking : So, I heard our office has turned into a haunted house, courtesy of a meme. I gotta say, I never thought I'd see the day.
:: Marko : grinning : Yeah, it's been wild! Did you hear that someone found a ghostly copy of a long-dead CEO in their cubicle? Talk about a blast from the past!
:: Devika : rolling eyes : You guys do realize that this whole paranormal meme thing is causing a major dip in productivity, right? We need to figure out how to stop it before it causes any real damage to the company.

:: Art : determined : Alright, team. We need a plan to banish this supernatural meme and restore order to Oddball Industries. Any suggestions?
:: Rachel : hesitantly : Well, according to my research, we might be able to cast some sort of counter-spell...or in our case, a digital counter-meme to neutralize the effects.
:: Nia : intrigued : That's so crazy it just might work. Let's give it a shot.
:: David : grinning : I can't believe we're about to cast a digital counter-meme spell. It's like something out of a bad sci-fi movie!
:: Carmen : enthusiastically : Right, let's get to work and create the greatest counter-spell meme in internet history. The fate of Oddball Industries depends on it.
:: Marcus : dramatically : Indeed! We shall be the heroes of the digital age, vanquishing the supernatural meme and restoring peace and sanity to our beloved office!
