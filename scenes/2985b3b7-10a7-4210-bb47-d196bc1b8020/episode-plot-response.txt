title: Paranormal Office Memes Unleashed
exposition: The receptionist Rachel, during one of her internet rabbit hole trips researching historical oddities, accidentally introduces a supernatural eternal chain meme to the office communication channels. It attaches itself to every staff member regardless of attempts to block, without knowing how dangerous it is, everyone groans under this new unwanted disturbance to their already stressed schedules.

rising action: Soon enough, something eerie begins to manifest in the workplace. Ghostly copies of long-dead CEOs, peculiar objects that trigger memories of internet-spawned folklore, and non-existent meetings with inter-dimensional beings in the elevators--these occurrences escalate the absurd paranormal activities in the office. The overall productivity takes a hit as everyone's wondering whether someone is pranking them or if there is a truth to paranormal world.

climax: Realizing the glowing abyss that hosts the conference room door wasn't supposed to be a working art installation after all, CEO Art Beecham calls an elaborate meeting despite his fear of people talking quickly past him. An anonymous tip leads back to the meme that Rachel released into their digital hemisphere, and they all connect-the-dots: together, they collectively cast a spell, sort of speaking, formally rejecting the "dangerous enjoyment" they were having with fear-and-laughter inducing supernatural oddities but unexpectedly manifesting mischief on their own. 

falling action: Raising an eyebrow to each other around the haunted conference table, the team divides into pairs considering their respective expertise and charisma. After improvising paranormal de-humour oaths unintentionally peppered in tongue-in-cheek boobooyorvoushtras (bizarre Russian family gatherings), best efforts are channeled and through an attempt to stream live footage of a dramatic, emotional ritual. This should sent lasting e-vibes cleansing the offices of their utterly intangible evil.

resolution: Oddball Industries return to unwanted normalcy as staff starts to re-group after finally disabling that ungodly supernatural digital force threatening potential zombie-like chaos in their precious building oasis. With raised glasses of innovation energy and dramatically distressed quotes on black coffee dotted mugs (several survived white-knuckle bowl panic laughter about T-shirts worn looking for cubicles behind a mild montage of tears), silly story anecdotes are retold daily while work chugalugs along with better appreciable amusement in and of wildly puzzling real-life antics encountered the week before.
