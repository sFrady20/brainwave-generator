>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Liam, Marcus, David
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, you won't believe what I just found! There's this meme about historical oddities, and it's been circulating since the dawn of the internet. I heard that when you share it, something strange and supernatural happens!
:: Liam : skeptical : Oh, really? You know these things are usually just internet hoaxes, right? But hey, as long as it doesn't hurt our sales numbers, I don't mind a little office distraction.
:: Marcus : intrigued : Ah, the mystical power of memes! But beware, Rachel, introducing such a force into our daily routine may bring about unforeseen consequences.
:: David : chuckling : As long as it doesn't make me trip over any more chairs, I'm all for it. But seriously, Rachel, be careful with those internet rabbit holes – they can be pretty addictive.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Art, Carmen, Devika
:: Art : exasperated : I don't know what's gotten into everyone today, but as charming as these distractions can be, our productivity is at an all-time low.
:: Carmen : amused : Oh, come on, Art. Haven't you ever heard of a little thing called chaos theory? Sometimes you just have to roll with the punches and see what life throws at you.
:: Devika : thoughtful : You know, there might be some truth to that chain meme. I've been reading about ancient Tibetan curses hidden in innocuous-looking text. Maybe we've unleashed something we can't control?

>> [15] > 4/5 - Nia, Marko, Sam, Mike
:: Nia : concerned : I must admit, I'm starting to see the effects of this so-called chain meme. We need to find a way to contain it before it spirals out of control.
:: Marko : joking : Well, I don't know about you, but I've always wanted to be part of a real-life Ghostbusters scenario. Who's with me?
:: Sam : serious : I don't like the sound of this one bit. We need to buckle down and focus on our jobs, not chase after internet myths.
:: Mike : light-hearted : As much as I love the idea of paranormal shenanigans, maybe we should just... try to delete the meme?
