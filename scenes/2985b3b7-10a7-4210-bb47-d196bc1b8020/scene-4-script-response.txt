>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Liam, Rachel, Carmen
:: Art : relieved : Ah, it seems like we've finally gotten rid of that pesky supernatural meme! I never thought I'd see the day when our office would be haunted by ghostly CEOs and elevator meetings with inter-dimensional beings.
:: Nia : chuckling : I must admit, it was quite the experience, Art. But we managed to come together as a team and create the perfect counter-spell meme to fight off the paranormal menace. It's a valuable lesson in teamwork and innovation, wouldn't you agree?
:: Liam : grinning : Yeah, I mean, who knew that the same people who forgot to order paper towels for the break room could pull together and save our office from supernatural doom? It truly is a testament to the power of our collective insanity!
:: Rachel : laughing : I still can't believe that I was the one who accidentally unleashed that meme. I mean, I was just trying to find something to pass the time during my lunch break. Who knew that we would all end up taking part in a wild, workplace exorcism?
:: Carmen : smirking : Well, at least we can all say we've had a truly Oddball experience, right? Now that things are back to normal, we can focus on getting some work done and enjoying the more mundane aspects of life, like our daily cups of coffee and the ongoing mystery of who keeps stealing all the good pens.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Devika, Marko
:: Marcus : reminiscing : You know, that whole paranormal meme incident almost makes me miss the good old days when we just had to worry about rogue paper jams and spilled coffee. 
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, but at least we got a few good stories out of it. Remember when Art tried to exorcise the printer with a stapler and some binder clips? I still don't know what he was thinking.
:: Devika : amused : I'll never forget the sight of the ghostly CEO raiding the vending machine! It's not every day you see an apparition munching on chips and chocolate bars. 
:: Marko : grinning : Well, it seems like our office really lives up to its name—Oddball Industries, indeed. But hey, it's never a dull moment around here! Who knows what crazy adventures we'll get up to next?

== In this act, the employees of Oddball Industries reflect on the recent paranormal events, as they return to their normal work routines. They bond over their shared experience and enjoy some light-hearted banter about the strange incidents during the supernatural meme crisis. With the office now rid of the paranormal threat, the staff embraces the newfound normalcy and focuses on their day-to-day tasks, while still occasionally reminiscing about their bizarre adventures.
