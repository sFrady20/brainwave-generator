>> [15] > 4/5 - Art, Nia, Liam, Marcus
:: Art : excited : Gather 'round, everyone! I've found this relic of a film called "Goonies" in my dad's ancient archives, and I thought it would be a hoot to watch it together as an office bonding experience. So, let's grab some popcorn, get those peepers ready, and dive into the world of 1985!
:: Nia : amused : Art, this is so unlike you, but honestly, I'm all in for an unexpected movie break. I could use something to break up the monotony of financial reports and strategy meetings.
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, Art, your newfound love for the dusty cinematic tales of yore warms the heart. But really, I'm always down for some entertainment. Count me in!
:: Marcus : laughing : This is either going to be a fantastic bonding experience or a hilarious trainwreck. Either way, I'm ready for the ride!

>> [10] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, David
:: Art : fascinated : Just when you thought the Oddball offices couldn't get any more interesting! Apparently, One-Eyed Willie's treasure is hidden right here in our very own building. What are the odds?!
:: Nia : incredulous : Art, seriously? Do you really believe a fictional movie treasure is hiding in our office? You do know it's just a movie, right?
:: David : playing along : Well, why not? Stranger things have happened around here. And imagine the bragging rights if we actually found it! We'd be internet legends!

>> [15] > 3/5 - Carmen, Rachel, Devika
:: Carmen : enthused : So, this treasure hunt is going to be absolutely bonkers. I mean, who knows what corners of our minds we'll explore, all while uncovering the hidden fortune that awaits us!
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Sure, because nothing screams "professionalism" more than hunting for a movie treasure in our office. But hey, if it provides a laugh or two, I'm in!
:: Devika : whimsical : You never know, maybe we'll find some hidden secrets, both within ourselves and our beloved Oddball Industries office. Let's see where this journey takes us!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, Liam, Marko
:: Marcus : animated : I don't know about you guys, but I'm pumped for this treasure hunt! We could be sitting on a gold mine, or at the very least, an absurdly fun adventure!
:: Liam : grinning : I'm all for uncovering the secrets of this building, as long as we don't get trapped in a bottomless pit or something. But seriously, let's find that treasure!
:: Marko : jovial : I've got my treasure hunting hat on, and I've heard Frank the goldfish has a keen sense for buried booty. We're going to be unstoppable!
