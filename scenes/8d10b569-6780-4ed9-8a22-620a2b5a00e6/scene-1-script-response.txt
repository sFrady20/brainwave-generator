>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Art : excited : Gather round everyone! Inspired by our little movie escapade, I thought we could all use a fun diversion from our mundane office tasks. Today, we shall embark on an adventure, a thrilling treasure hunt to find the hidden treasure of One-Eyed Willie right here in our office building!
:: David : chuckling : Art, you've either had too much caffeine or you're just taking this Goonies thing a tad too seriously. I mean, I get it, it's a classic, but a treasure hidden in our office? That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Oh David, ye of little faith! I'm on board with this treasure hunt, Art. It'd be a nice change of pace from filing reports all day. Plus, just imagine the bragging rights if we actually find something!
:: Rachel : grinning : I'm with Carmen on this one! I know it sounds crazy, but can you imagine how much fun it would be to hunt for treasure in the office? Come on, David, don't be such a downer. Let's add a little excitement to our day!

>> [17] > 2/2 - Liam, Marcus
:: Liam : smirking : So, Marcus, any thoughts on where we should start looking for this treasure? I've got a hunch there's something cloaked deep within the realms of the printer room.
:: Marcus : dramatically : Liam, my fellow adventurer, I believe you may be onto something. Perhaps we must decipher the cryptic messages hidden within the printed pages of our mundane office documents! Let us journey into the dusty, ink-filled labyrinth of the printer room and uncover its secrets!

>> [8] > 3/3 - Devika, Marko, Nia
:: Devika : excited : You know what would be a great way to search for the treasure? We could use random office supplies as makeshift tools! I've always said that staplers and hole-punchers hold untold mysteries just waiting to be unlocked.
:: Marko : laughing : Devika, you really have a knack for turning the mundane into the extraordinary. But you know what? I'm in! Let's uncover the hidden secrets of everyday office supplies and see if they can lead us to the treasure. And if not, it'll still make for an epic story, mate!
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : I swear, you all have lost your minds, but if this treasure hunt is what it takes to bring some life back into the office, then count me in. Just try not to disrupt our actual work too much, alright? We still need to meet our deadlines.

>> [5] > 3/3 - Art, Carmen, Rachel
:: Art : eagerly : Alright, team! To the elevator, our first stop on this grand adventure! Who knows what clues and hidden messages we may find lurking within the confines of this small, metal box?
:: Carmen : playfully : Oh, Art, your enthusiasm is absolutely contagious! I can't wait to see what we uncover on this wild ride of ours. Maybe there's a treasure map tucked away in the emergency phone panel?
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Every time I ride the elevator, I can feel the spirit of One-Eyed Willie watching over us. Who knew that this seemingly mundane space holds the key to untold riches?
