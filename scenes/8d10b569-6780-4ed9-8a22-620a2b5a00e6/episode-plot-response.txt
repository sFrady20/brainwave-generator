title: The One-Gadget Project
exposition: Art Beecham finds an ancient VHS tape of the 1985 film "Goonies" in his father's belongings and decides to show it during a staff movie afternoon. To everyone's fascination, they learn about the infamous One-Eyed Willie's treasure hidden somewhere in the office building they currently occupy.

rising action: Inspired by their recent cinematic experience, Art and his employees suddenly become amateur treasure hunters attempting to find hidden treasure within their office building as various teams around the company work together using random office supplies and methods.

climax: As each group – consisting at least one key team member – fan out around the building and decode cryptic riddles using fax machines, sticky notes, and retired hardware, tension mounts at who will manage to uncover the legendary treasure.

falling action: Progressing through a series of goofy challenges, adventurous mishaps, and wonky treasure map interpretive dances, the office staff closes in on the final resting place of One-Eyed Willie's treasure.

resolution: The quest leads them to Art Beecham's own office, only to find a team-building board game created by his father. In the end, the real treasure was the zany and absurd moments of camaraderie that managed to bond the Oddball team together, and the much-anticipated treasure turns out to be an extremely entertaining board game that goes on to become a viral internet sensation overnight.
