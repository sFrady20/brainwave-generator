>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Marcus, Liam
:: Nia : excited : Okay, guys, so we're almost there! We've been through fax machines, storage rooms, and the media room. We're getting closer to One-Eyed Willie's treasure. What's next?
:: Marcus : chuckling : You know what? I reckon we just might find it near the boss's office. After all, his dad used to own this place, and he's the one who left us this wacky treasure map. Maybe we should check out Art's office?
:: Liam : sarcastically : Oh, that's just brilliant, Marcus! Let's just barge into Art's office and start digging around for some mythical treasure. I'm sure he'll love that idea. But hey, what have we got to lose? It's been entertaining so far, might as well see it through.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : surprised : What on earth are you three doing in here? And what's with all the crazy antics out there today?
:: Nia : sheepishly : Well, Art, we've been, uh, following a treasure map. It all started with the Goonies movie you showed us, and well, we kind of went down a rabbit hole...
:: Marcus : grinning : And it has led us right here, to your office! According to our calculations, One-Eyed Willie's treasure should be hidden somewhere nearby.
:: Art : laughing : You've got to be kidding me. Alright, let's take a look around. I'm dying to see what you'll find!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Samantha
:: Rachel : out of breath : Team, we've just received word from Nia and Marcus that the treasure is somewhere close to Art's office. Let's get moving!
:: David : excited : I can't believe we're almost there! This has been like one wild escape room experience, right in our own office.
:: Carmen : smirking : I'm honestly going to miss all this craziness. It's been a nice break from the usual office routine.
:: Samantha : focused : Let's not get too sentimental just yet. We've got a treasure to find! Let's go!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : astonished : Well, I never thought I'd be doing this in my own office, but it seems the treasure hunt has led us to something after all! 
:: Nia : impressed : I can't believe it. It's a team-building board game that your dad designed, Art. Who knew this whole adventure would lead us to this?
:: Marcus : reflecting : You know, maybe the real treasure was the journey we took together as a team. All the laughs, the banter, and the camaraderie we shared along the way. I think we're walking away from this treasure hunt with something even more valuable – a stronger bond as a team.

== In this act, the office staff progress through more goofy challenges, adventurous mishaps, and wonky treasure map interpretive dances, ultimately leading them to Art's office. With the anticipation at its peak, they discover that the treasure they sought was a team-building board game created by Art's dad. Through all the absurdity and irreverent jokes, the characters realize that the true treasure was the camaraderie they built throughout the treasure hunt.
