>> [11] > 3/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, I think I found a clue scribbled under the kitchen counter! It says, "The fax machine holds the key, but only when the paper runs free."
:: David : amused : That sounds about as reliable as my horoscope last week that told me I'd find inner peace through underwater basket weaving. But hey, it's worth a shot.
:: Carmen : laughing : David, your horoscope must have been on to something, because I've always found solace in the rhythmic sound of underwater weaving. But back to this clue - I say we check out the fax machine! Every adventure starts with a leap of faith, right?

>> [17] > 2/2 - David, Rachel
:: David : nervously : So, we're at the printer. Which button do I press to unleash the cryptic wisdom of this ancient artifact?
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Just hit the "Print 10,000 treasure maps" button, David. Seriously, though, try the one that says "Fax." It might just spit out a clue.
:: David : pressing the button : Alright, here goes nothing...

>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Rachel, Carmen, Liam
:: Liam : surprised : What have we got here? A treasure hunt? Count me in!
:: David : grinning : You're just in time! The fax machine just printed out a mysterious riddle: "Retire the mouse that clicks, and you'll find a treasure trove of tricks."
:: Rachel : excited : This is getting intense! We should check the old storage room. I bet there are heaps of retired hardware in there!
:: Carmen : agreeing : Great idea, Rachel! To the storage room, we go!

>> [6] > 3/3 - David, Rachel, Carmen
:: David : shocked : Whoa, I've never seen so many ancient relics in one place. Do you think this is where office supplies come to die?
:: Rachel : searching : Focus, David! We're looking for a retired mouse. Let's dig through these boxes and see if we can find the next clue.
:: Carmen : holding a mouse : Is this it? It looks like it hasn't clicked in decades. I bet this is our treasure trove of tricks!

>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Rachel, Carmen, Marcus
:: Marcus : joining in : Ahoy there, fellow treasure hunters! I overheard your escapades and must join in on this zany journey!
:: Rachel : enthusiastic : Of course, Marcus! We just found a retired mouse in the storage room, and now we must uncover its secrets!
:: Carmen : inspecting the mouse : There's a small note taped to the bottom! It reads, "In the shadows of green, the answer is seen."
:: David : pondering : Green shadows... could it be the green screen in the media room?

>> [10] > 3/3 - David, Rachel, Marcus
:: Marcus : observant : My dear treasure hunters, observe the shadows cast upon yonder green screen. What does your inner pirate see?
:: David : squinting : I see... darkness. Darkness and a growing sense of existential dread.
:: Rachel : pointing : Wait! I see it! There's a tiny message in the corner. "The treasure lies within the heart of Oddball Industries."
