>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Nia, Marcus, Carmen
:: Art : excited : So, we're really doing this then, a telethon? I've never been a part of one, but if we're going all out, let's make it epic! Let's get some big names and a few surprises.
:: Nia : determined : Absolutely, Art. We need to make this telethon one for the ages, to overshadow the prank meme and remind people what Oddball Industries is really about.
:: Marcus : grinning : Oh, I have some ideas! How about inviting that guy who does online comedy sketches, and maybe a popular Twitch streamer? We could get them to do live performances!
:: Carmen : thrilled : And a surprise musical guest, of course! Let's aim for the stars! The bigger, the better! 

>> [15] > 5/5 - Liam, David, Devika, Rachel, Marko
:: Liam : boasting : I've already started working on my act, it's going to be a hilarious stand-up set full of office humor that'll have everyone in stitches!
:: David : chuckling : Knowing you, Liam, I'm sure it'll be a bit embellished, but I bet it'll still be funny. I'll be doing some improv with a few other coworkers, so we'll add to the laughter too.
:: Devika : thoughtful : I think it would be cool to do a live coding challenge, maybe I could code a small game on the spot, and the audience could play it online.
:: Rachel : excited : That's such a unique idea, Devika! I was thinking of doing a live interactive quiz, with the audience submitting questions, and whoever gets the most right wins some company swag!
:: Marko : grinning : I'll do a live painting while beatboxing! It'll be a visual and auditory masterpiece!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, T-Pain

:: T-Pain : knowledgeable : Well, Art, there are some amazing Canadian and Armenian artists who have had a huge impact on the hip-hop scene. They bring in elements of their own culture, which enriches the genre, you know?
:: Nia : impressed : That's fascinating, T-Pain. We're so glad to have you as part of our telethon, and we look forward to learning more about the diverse influences in hip-hop today.
