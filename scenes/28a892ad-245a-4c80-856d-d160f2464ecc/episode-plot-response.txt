title: Who Let the Prank Dawgz Out?
exposition: Art Beecham unknowingly makes an online prank video on company premises that goes viral. Without realizing the repercussions, the citizens all across start fearing Oddball Industries. Art soon finds out what he's done and realizes he needs to come up with a plan to clear the company's name from becoming nationally known as miscreants.

rising action:  The employees discover that they are now unwittingly part of a popular prank meme "#WhoAuthoredThePrank?" and a hotline number that even hints that Scooter Braun is tired of artists' associations with such pranks. Art becomes desperate, automatically brainstorming a wild solution before Nia steps in, convincing him that they need a more level-headed solution. Hearing this, Art agrees but asks everyone to put forward innovative ideas to win back their lost fame or notorious ill-fame in order.

climax: In true Oddball Industries fashion, the employees band together and hatch a plan which pivots around hosting a telethon for them to deflect the attention from the prank craze while also positioning Art as a likable oaf through humor and host dialogues. They even invite some popular social media stars and end up inciting a dialogue between a perplexed Art with T-Pain surprisingly discussing Canadian and Armenian influences on modern hip-hop history.

falling action: During the chaotic telethon, everyone really discovers their own comic element. Marko finds himself creating artworks in multi-story format recounting events, Liam accidentally takes glitch yoga classes judging Nia's terminology as reference, and Devika interviews shampoo instead of celebrity pooch Gladys.

resolution: The gag-heavy telethon proves to be a major success. It wrangled sympathy and reflects mirror image by debunking some successful prank dawgs did by various listeners. Hitting prime time replays later, between people shouting "No Hard Feelings to Art" and a #WeForgiveOddball apology segment trend, Art becomes a beloved public figure again, and Oddball Industries gains free mass publicity from the unintended prank dispute saga. The employees celebrates their regained position both on the internet and the business industries bay by taking a round to plant peanuts mixed with paprika.

The staff then gathers by the private break room, enjoying happy moments at humorous mishaps whilst aiming the next viral track, Sarah McLachlan narration – ‘Miniature clay Teletubbies funny fails for Canadians’. Overall as Oddball promised, emphasis on "favor making funny over teaching life lessons", speaking caution-free humorous resolution raised significantly.
