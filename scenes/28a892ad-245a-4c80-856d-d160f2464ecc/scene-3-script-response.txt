>> [11] > 4/4 - Marko, Liam, Nia, Carmen
:: Marko : excited : So guys, I have this amazing idea for an art piece during the telethon. I'm thinking of creating a live, multi-story artwork that captures the essence of this crazy event. I'll be working on it throughout the telethon, giving the audience a visual representation of our journey back to fame.
:: Liam : laughing : Oh, that's brilliant, Marko! Now, you know what could really add some flair to this event? I heard Nia talking about some "glitch yoga." I think I'll give it a shot on stage. We want this telethon to be as ridiculous and entertaining as possible, right?

:: Nia : chuckling : Liam, you really misunderstood me! I said "pitch yoga" as in throwing ideas around. But you know what? Glitch yoga sounds hilarious. Go for it, and maybe you'll start a new trend!
:: Carmen : amused : This is going to be a wild ride! I can't wait to see how this all unfolds. I just hope we don't end up creating any more internet memes. Oh, and speaking of wild, did you hear that Devika scored an interview with a celebrity pooch?

>> [3] > 3/3 - Devika, David, Rachel
:: Devika : confused : Guys, I've made a huge mistake. Instead of grabbing the celebrity dog, Gladys, for my interview, I accidentally interviewed...shampoo? How did this even happen? My scatterbrained ways have gotten the best of me once again!
:: David : laughing : Well, on the bright side, that's bound to be a memorable interview! Maybe you can spin it into a hilarious "Shampoo vs. Celebrity Pooch" segment. The audience will be in stitches!
:: Rachel : grinning : I can just see the headlines now: "Oddball Industries: Home of the Shampoo Interview." Honestly, this telethon is turning out to be the perfect way to showcase our company's quirky nature.

>> [20] > 3/3 - Art, T-Pain, Marcus
:: Art : in awe : I can't believe T-Pain is here at our telethon! So, T-Pain, tell us about the Canadian and Armenian influences in modern hip-hop history. I never would have guessed that connection, but then again, we're all about the unexpected here at Oddball Industries!
:: T-Pain : knowledgeable : Sure thing, Art! Well, artists like Drake from Canada and Armenian-American producers like AraabMuzik have made a significant impact in the hip-hop scene. They've infused their unique cultural backgrounds into the music, creating some fresh and innovative sounds.

:: Marcus : impressed : That's truly fascinating! Just like our telethon's wild mix of acts, it seems like hip-hop is always evolving and embracing diverse influences. Perhaps our shampoo interview could be the next big thing in the music industry!
:: T-Pain : amused : Who knows, Marcus? Stranger things have happened in the music world. Oddball Industries sure knows how to throw a telethon. Keep up the good work, guys!

== In this act, the employees work on their chaotic and entertaining telethon. Marko starts his multi-story live art piece, Liam misinterprets Nia's words and decides to try "glitch yoga" on stage. Devika accidentally interviews shampoo instead of a celebrity dog. Art and T-Pain discuss Canadian and Armenian influences in modern hip-hop history during the telethon.
