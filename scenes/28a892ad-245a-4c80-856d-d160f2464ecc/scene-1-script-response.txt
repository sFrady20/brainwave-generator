>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : panicked : What have I done? My innocent prank video has turned the whole company into a laughing stock! We've got to clear our name, guys! I'm thinking something extravagant, maybe a parade or... a skywriting apology?
:: Nia : stern : Art, hold on a sec. We don't want to overreact here, and we definitely don't want to make things worse. Maybe we should just take a moment, sit down, and come up with a more sensible solution together.
:: Marcus : amused : Even if we go the way of the skywriting apology, I wouldn't be surprised if someone in town left a review asking if we were confessing to crop circles as well!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : worried : This whole prank meme trend is getting way out of hand! I just got a call from my aunt asking if I knew a "Scooter Braun" because she heard he might sue us!
:: David : chuckling : I bet Scooter himself would get a kick out of that rumor! The poor guy's probably just trying to enjoy a quiet day at home, but now he's unwittingly become part of our Oddball drama.
:: Carmen : sarcastic : Well, you know what they say: there's no such thing as bad publicity! Maybe we can use this hot mess to our advantage, like launching a new product line called "Prank Dawgz: For the Mischievous at Heart."
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, Carmen, that's brilliant! We could sell shirts with our faces on them, with a slogan like "Oddball Industries: We Put the 'Fun' in Dysfunction!" This could be a goldmine!

>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Art, Marcus
:: Nia : determined : Alright, everyone, let's get serious. We need to come up with a well-thought-out plan to deal with this prank meme mess. I want each one of you to put forward your best ideas for how we can win back our reputation and make Oddball Industries respected once again.
:: Art : contemplative : You're right, Nia, it's time to buckle down and prove to the world that we're more than just a company of pranksters. Let's put our heads together and work on this as a team.
:: Marcus : inspired : I've got an idea! Why don't we create a viral video of our own, but this time it's about us helping the community or doing some good deeds? We can show the world that we're not all about pranks and mischief but are a socially responsible company too.

== In this act, the Oddball Industries staff discovers that they've become part of a popular prank meme and a hotline rumor linking them to Scooter Braun. As the situation spirals out of control, Nia convinces Art that they need a sensible solution to restore the company's reputation. Art agrees, and the employees start brainstorming ideas to prove that they're more than just pranksters. Marcus proposes creating a viral video of the company doing good deeds to shift public perception in their favor.
