>> [15] > 4/5 - Art, Nia, Devika, David
:: Art : elated : I can't believe the telethon was such a success! I never thought I'd become a beloved public figure again. Thank you, everyone! I think we should celebrate by planting peanuts mixed with paprika, just for the heck of it!
:: Nia : amused : That sounds like a fitting celebration, Art. We've certainly earned some fun after all the hard work we put into the telethon. I don't think I'll ever forget Liam's "glitch yoga" or Devika interviewing shampoo.
:: Devika : chuckling : In my defense, I thought I was interviewing a celebrity dog named Shampoo. It was an honest mistake, but it did add to the entertainment factor!
:: David : laughing : It's not every day you see a shampoo bottle take center stage in a live show. Let's take this wacky Oddball energy and spread it to the rest of the world by planting those peanuts and paprika!

>> [13] > 3/3 - Carmen, Marcus, Rachel
:: Carmen : excited : Hey, guys! Did you hear about the telethon? We've become internet sensations overnight! We should celebrate in some quirky way, like planting peanuts mixed with paprika!
:: Marcus : ecstatic : I love that idea, Carmen! We can make it a new Oddball Industries tradition, and every time we have a success, we'll plant some peanuts and paprika. That'll be our mark on the world!
:: Rachel : grinning : I'll get started on printing up some aprons with "#WeForgiveOddball" on them! We can wear them while we plant our peanuts and paprika, and take some pictures to show our followers that we know how to have a good time.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Marko, Sam, Mike
:: Liam : proud : So, guys, what do you think about the success of our telethon? I think my glitch yoga performance was the highlight of the show, even if it was...unintended. The internet sure is loving it!
:: Marko : joking : Liam, your glitch yoga was a sight to behold! I think it'll become the next viral challenge. As for my live art piece, the internet seems to appreciate the chaos we managed to create on stage.
:: Sam : smirking : The telethon was definitely entertaining, and I'm glad that we were able to clear Oddball Industries' name. But now, let's focus on our next project: planting peanuts mixed with paprika!
:: Mike : chuckling : That's an oddly specific way to celebrate, but sure, let's do it! It's definitely on-brand for us here at Oddball Industries.
