title: The Alien Ambassador Affair
exposition: Art receives a mysterious package at the office, claiming from an anonymous source that a dignitary from an advanced alien civilization is going to arrive at Oddball Industries for an urgent meeting. Art, being his usual gullible self, takes the message seriously and assembles the team to prepare for this unusual event.

rising action: The office buzzes as the team races against the clock to create extravagant welcoming de_corations and cater for strange alien preferences. Internally, conflicts arise when Liam casts doubt about the authenticity of the message, while most of the team launch into internet conspiracy theories about cool new gadgets, befriending stars, and posing for selfies with visitors from near space.

climax: As social media spreads news of odd goings-on in the company, curious journalists gather outside the office just in time for the team to roll out the holographic red carpet. Much to everyone's shock, the "alien" arrives and turns out to be a mysterious humanoid-shaped drone. Disoriented, the team panics while Nia and Carmen struggle to hold an impromptu press conference with confused journalists who say the drones rank absurd internet prankery.

falling action: Some of the staff engage in an odd impromptu meet and greet with the technician directing the drone. Despite some blooper-worthy knee slapping accidents, the misunderstanding results grow viral over the internet, and an online support group pops up combining UFO hunters, alien conspiracy enthusiasts and blind devotees to alien diplomacy 

resolution: The office team is thrilled when they gain a ton of unlikely new fans and sign more clients who were charmed by their "creative viral marketing". Meanwhile, Devika and Marko secretly plot to create more oddball publicity stunts for the company, to transform Oddball Industries into the internet folklore industry's most beloved partner.
