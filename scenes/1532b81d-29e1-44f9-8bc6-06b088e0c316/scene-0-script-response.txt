>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, David
:: Art : excited : Well folks, we just got the most unusual package today! Apparently, a dignitary from an advanced alien civilization is about to arrive for an urgent meeting at Oddball Industries! Can you believe it? We're making intergalactic connections!
:: Nia : skeptical : Art, are you sure this isn't some kind of prank? I mean, an alien ambassador visiting our humble office? 
:: David : chuckling : Maybe it's just another one of those wacky Oddball Industries fans trying to get our attention. Although, an alien visit could make for some interesting water cooler talk!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Marcus, Carmen, Rachel
:: Liam : smirking : So, I heard we're expecting some extraterrestrial company soon. You guys really think this is legit?
:: Marcus : ecstatic : I, for one, welcome our alien overlords! Just imagine the interstellar shenanigans we could get up to!
:: Carmen : playful : I've always wanted to start an intergalactic salsa dance party! Think they'd be up for it?
:: Rachel : giggling : Maybe we could introduce them to the wonders of internet memes and cat videos!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Devika, Marko, Sam
:: Devika : intrigued : What do you think their technology is like? I bet it's amazing! I wonder if they've conquered the world of quantum computing.
:: Marko : daydreaming : Oh, mate, can you just imagine the artistic possibilities? We could create holographic designs that are out of this world—literally!
:: Sam : deadpan : I'm more concerned about the security risks. How do we know these aliens aren't here to steal our secrets or take over the company?

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, David
:: Art : determined : Regardless of what others may think, I believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Oddball Industries! Let's prepare for their arrival and show them what we're made of!
:: Nia : sighing : Fine, Art. We'll get the team ready for this...alien ambassador. But if this turns out to be a hoax, we're going to have a serious talk about gullibility.
:: David : grinning : I can already see the headlines: "Oddball Industries - The First Interstellar Software Company!" Let's hope they like our human sense of humor.
