>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Marcus : excitedly : Alright guys, we don't have a lot of time! We need to create the most out-of-this-world welcome for our alien visitors! I'm thinking a holographic banner, and maybe we can find some of that "moon cheese" people talk about?
:: David : laughing : Moon cheese? Marcus, do you actually believe that's a thing? I mean, I'm all for a warm welcome, but let's not venture too far into the realms of absurdity.
:: Carmen : smirking : David, you've got to think bigger! This is our chance to impress the stars, literally! We could make a galactic playlist for the background music – our visitors should appreciate some Earth tunes, right?
:: Liam : skeptically : Hold on, are we seriously spending time and resources on this? Aren't we just setting ourselves up for disappointment when it turns out to be a hoax? I'm not so sure an interstellar software company is our best bet for success.
>> [17] > 2/2 - Rachel, Devika
:: Rachel : nervously : Devika, I've been trying to print out welcome signs in every language I can think of, but, um... I don't exactly know how to write in alien. What do you think their language might look like?
:: Devika : quizzically : Rachel, that's a bit of a stretch, isn't it? For all we know, they could communicate through interpretive dance or telepathy. But hey, let's have fun with it! Print some signs with random shapes and symbols. You never know, we might get lucky!
>> [15] > 5/5 - Nia, Art, Marko, Sam, Mike
:: Nia : reluctantly : Art, while I don't necessarily agree with this whole alien situation, I'll help organize this "welcoming party" for our guests. But if it turns out to be a hoax, we're going to have to find a way to save face.
:: Art : confidently : Nia, once we've forged a partnership with these aliens, Oddball Industries will be on the interstellar map! People will be begging to work with us, and we'll be the talk of the galaxy!
:: Marko : jokingly : So, Art, does that mean we get to take selfies with our new alien friends? I can already see the Instagram hashtags... #ExtraterrestrialBuddies and #SpacePals!
:: Sam : deadpan : As amusing as that sounds, Marko, I think we should focus on making sure our security protocols can handle visitors from another planet. We don't want intergalactic criminals on our hands.
:: Mike : chuckling : Oh, Sam, always the voice of reason. But you've got a point – better safe than sorry when it comes to aliens, right?
== In this act, the office buzzes with activity as the team prepares for the arrival of the alleged alien ambassador. Marcus, David, Carmen, and Liam discuss extravagant decorations and catering ideas, while Liam remains skeptical about the authenticity of the message. Rachel and Devika create welcoming signs in various languages, including some "alien" symbols for good measure. Nia agrees to help prepare for the arrival, despite her reservations, and Art envisions the company's potential new status as an interstellar software company.
