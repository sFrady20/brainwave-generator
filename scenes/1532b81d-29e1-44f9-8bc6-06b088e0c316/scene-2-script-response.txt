>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Marcus
:: Nia : concerned : Oh my goodness, there are journalists gathering outside already. Is this really happening? I still can't wrap my head around the idea that we're about to welcome an "alien ambassador."
:: Carmen : excitedly : I know, right? I'm still not 100% sure this isn't just an elaborate prank, but can you imagine the headlines if it's true? "Oddball Industries hosts intergalactic peace talks!"
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh, we're definitely going viral with this one. I've never seen the office so hyped up about anything before. 

>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Art, David, Rachel
:: Liam : sarcastically : To think we're about to meet our interstellar neighbors, and all we've got is a holographic red carpet and some dodgy welcome signs. This'll go down in history, alright!
:: Art : dreamily : I know it sounds crazy, Liam, but just imagine... Oddball Industries could become the first software company to work with aliens. We'd be pioneers!
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, pioneers, Art... or just the next office space pinata for internet pranksters. I'm still on the fence about this whole thing.
:: Rachel : optimistically : Well, I think it's going to be a memorable day, regardless of the outcome! And hey, at least our "alien" symbols look convincing, right?

>> [5] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Devika
:: Nia : nervously : Alright, the alien, or you know, "alien" is about to arrive. Devika, I hope you're ready to join Carmen and me in holding an impromptu press conference. 
:: Carmen : grinning : Oh, it's going to be a blast! If those journalists thought they were here for a boring software company meetup, they're in for a big surprise!
:: Devika : smirking : I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when they see the "alien" drone. Let's just hope it doesn't cause complete chaos.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Art
:: Nia : hurriedly : Okay, everyone! The drone has arrived! It's truly bizarre, but we need to put on a show for these journalists. Art, are you ready to greet our "guest"?
:: Art : excitedly : I've never been more ready for anything in my life! Let's make history and greet this mysterious drone as if it were a true interstellar visitor.
:: Carmen : chuckling : Alright, let's do this! We'll become the internet sensation for at least 15 minutes, and who knows, maybe the real aliens will see it and pay us a visit!
