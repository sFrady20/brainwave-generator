>> [11] > 4/4 - Carmen, Marcus, Nia, David
:: Carmen : excited : Guys, have you seen our Twitter? We're blowing up! People think our "alien" drone stunt was a hilarious viral marketing campaign. It's like we've hit the internet jackpot!
:: Marcus : laughing : Absolutely, Carmen! We're the accidental darlings of the internet, and I say we ride this wave of fame all the way to the top. Who knew a drone could generate so much buzz?
:: Nia : cautiously optimistic : As long I don't have to keep explaining our little misstep to journalists, I'm fine with it! The extra publicity and the new clients we've signed might just be a silver lining.
:: David : chuckling : With our newfound notoriety, I've got so many puns circling in my head! We need to "drone" up some more ideas to make sure we stay in the public's eye!

>> [8] > 3/3 - Devika, Marko, Liam
:: Devika : conspiratorially : Marko, I think we can capitalize on this unexpected success. We should brainstorm more oddball stunts to keep Oddball Industries in the limelight!
:: Marko : grinning : Absolutely, mate! We've got to keep this party going. What if we create viral videos featuring floating laptops in the office, powered by "alien technology"?
:: Liam : skeptical : As long as you two don't forget that we still have a business to run. But hey, if we get more clients and attention, I'm all for it. Just make sure it doesn't blow up in our faces... again.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Rachel, Mike, Sam
:: Rachel : excitedly : Can you believe it, guys? All because of a drone and Art's gullibility, we're practically internet famous now! I bet some of our new fans are already waiting for our next stunt.
:: Mike : amused : Yeah, who would've thought? But, you know, it's great for our team's morale. We could use the extra fun, and if it brings in more customers, why not?
:: Sam : deadpan : Just remember, we here at security need to keep our focus. The next publicity stunt might not be a harmless drone, but an actual threat. Let's not get too carried away.
