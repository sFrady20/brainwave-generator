:: Art : excited : Gather 'round, everyone! It's time to unveil the treasure that has eluded us for so long, and that has led us on this wild goose chase of misadventures and accidents!
:: Nia : sarcastic : Oh, joyous day! We stand united in our quest for this grand treasure, which I'm sure won't be a letdown after everything we've been through. Let's just hope it's worth it.
:: Marcus : grinning : Fear not, my fellow truth-seekers! For if there's one thing we Oddballs are known for, it's finding hilarity and meaning in even the most mundane of discoveries. Shall we proceed?

:: Art : opening the door : Behold, the company's secret room and the place where the treasure awaits! I suppose we should take a moment to thank Devika for her ingenious decryption skills.
:: Devika : modest : Aww, shucks, Art. It was just a bit of code-cracking. But seriously, what could be better than finding treasure in our very own office? 
:: Carmen : excited : I can't believe we're finally here! I'm sure whatever we find will be worth it, even if it's just a little token in our everyday Oddball lives.
:: Liam : chuckling : Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'll be satisfied with anything that makes our daily grind a bit more interesting—even if it's just a bunch of candy vending tokens.

:: Art : revealing the tokens : Behold, the treasure we've all been waiting for! Candy vending tokens galore!
:: Nia : surprised : Of all the things it could have been... candy vending tokens? I must admit, I did not see that coming.
:: Marcus : amused : See? I told you we'd find hilarity in the unexpected. If nothing else, these tokens may not be worth much, but they'll certainly make for a sweet story to tell.
:: David : laughing : You've got to admit, this whole wild adventure has certainly added some flavor to our office lives. Pun intended, of course.
:: Devika : eager : So, what are we waiting for? Let's all grab a token and enjoy a little treat like the Oddballs we are!

== In this act, the Oddball Industries employees gather outside the secret room, where they find the treasure—a trove of candy vending tokens as prophesized by Marcus. With mixed feelings, yet with everyone coming together, they partake in enjoying the anti-climactic treasure, relishing in the absurdity of their adventure.
