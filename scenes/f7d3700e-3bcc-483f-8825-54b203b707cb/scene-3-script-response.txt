:: Nia : sarcastically : Art, I've been trying to decipher this riddle for hours. Word by word, phrase by phrase, it's like it's just taunting me! It's honestly making me question my own sanity at this point.
:: David : chuckling : I'm no riddleologist, but I've got an idea. What if we try to look at it from a different perspective, like upside down or something? Maybe there's a hidden message only visible to those who aren't afraid to think... "upside downwards"?
:: Marcus : grinning : David, you never cease to amaze me with your out-of-the-box thinking. If we can't solve this riddle right-side-up, maybe we should flip it on its head! Let's give it a try!

:: Rachel : gossiping : You know, I heard from Mike that there's a secret room in our office that nobody knows about. Maybe that's where the treasure is? I mean, it's worth a shot, right?
