For this act, create multiple scenes that build up the plot:

>> [15] > 4/5 - Liam, Rachel, Carmen, David
:: Liam : exaggeratedly : Have you heard about the secret meetings happening around the office? Something's going down, and we're not in on it. The rumors are spreading faster than the time I won that hot dog eating contest.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, I'm sure it's as important as your so-called "hot dog eating" contest. But seriously, what could they be up to? Maybe it's a corporate takeover, or, you know, they're just discussing who has the best stapler. 
:: Carmen : jokingly : Or maybe they're forming a cult based on the teachings of an obscure '90s movie. I mean, who wouldn't want to follow the teachings of "Pluto Nash"?
:: David : laughing : Oh yeah, a cult devoted to the almighty Eddie Murphy, with all his wisdom and puns! Seriously though, we should try to find out what's going on before the whole office implodes from all this gossip.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Samantha, Marko, Devika
:: Samantha : seriously : I'm telling you, it's a sabotage attempt. They're up to something, and we need to be on our guard.
:: Marko : jokingly : Or maybe they're just trying to find the best hiding spot for a treasure hunt! I mean, who wouldn't want to search the office for hidden loot?
:: Devika : distractedly : Guys, let's not get carried away. It's probably just a new project they're discussing. No need to get paranoid about sabotage or treasure hunts.

>> [16] > 5/7 - Arthur, Nia, Marcus, David, Devika
:: Arthur : reluctantly : Alright, listen up. We've been decoding a cryptic riddle tied to the movie "Pluto Nash" for a hidden treasure. I know it sounds absurd, but I couldn't resist the potential payoff.
:: Nia : sternly : Art, you should have been more transparent with the team. Now everyone is on edge and jumping to wild conclusions.
:: Marcus : playfully : Well, on the bright side, we now have everyone's attention. So, why not join forces and solve this riddle together as a team?
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, we'll either find an actual treasure or just have one heck of a story to tell at the next office party.
:: Devika : confused : Well, I guess we're in this together now. Let's get to work and crack this riddle wide open. May the wisdom of "Pluto Nash" be with us!

== In this act, a company-wide conflict escalates due to the secret meetings and gossip. The accidental destruction of office equipment further fuels the tension. Eventually, Art reveals the true reason for the secrecy, and despite the initial reluctance, the employees join forces to solve the riddle. The act is filled with irreverent banter, offbeat humor, and cartoonishly ridiculous character portrayals as the characters attempt to solve the mystery of the riddle together.
