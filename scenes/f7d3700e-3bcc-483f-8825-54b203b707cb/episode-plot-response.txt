title: The Maltese Deadline
exposition: During a regular day at Oddball Industries, Art gets a mysterious sealed envelope from an anonymous sender, slipped under his door. Inside the envelope is a cryptic riddle hinting at hidden treasure tied to a specific keyword from an obscure '90s movie - "Pluto Nash".

rising action: Art, seeing dollar signs instead of revealing true intentions, secretly employs the help of Nia, David, Devika, and Marcus to decode the riddle together. Simultaneously, other employees begin noticing secret meetings and attempted obfuscation which drives curiosity to fever pitch. Conversations abound, split between whether they have uncovered corporate sabotage, nefarious plots, or simply more mundane power plays perceived as hidden treasures.

climax: A company-wide conflict escalates, fueled by rampant gossip and the coinciding accidental destruction of office equipment. The prying eyes finally precipitate a forced confrontation in which Art unwillingly comes clean about the treasure implied by the cryptic message. The bigger confession exposes his own misguided material priorities, but everyone—now invested—joins forces to help solve the secret riddle.

falling action: Comedy ensues as each interpretation of the riddle delivers bizarre and unfortunate results such as activating unintentional conspiracies and prompting accidents. Lastly, Devika manages to decrypt the message convincing the team that the treasure is located in their very own headquarters - the company's secret room.

resolution: Assembling en masse outside of the secret room, they collectively resolve to _actually_ find the treasure—a trove candy vending tokens prophesized by Marcus. Despite realizing the treasure's anti-climactic nature and conflicts endured, the office casts subtly unsettling smiles amidst predictable underweights of relief, while everyone semi-willingly partakes in consuming this quaint revelatory memento together.
