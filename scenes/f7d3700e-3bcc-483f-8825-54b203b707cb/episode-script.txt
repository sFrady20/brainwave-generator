>> [19] > 1/3 - Art
:: Art : puzzled : What on earth is this? An envelope under my door? Let's see here... "To the one who seeks the unknown, the treasure you'll find is tied to the magic word from Pluto Nash." What kind of cryptic nonsense is this?
>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : curious : Hey Art, what's all the hush-hush about? You seem a bit flustered.
:: Art : hesitantly : Well, Nia, I received this mysterious envelope with a riddle hinting at some hidden treasure. It's tied to a keyword from the movie "Pluto Nash".
:: Nia : smirking : Seriously? That movie was a flop! But I'm intrigued, boss. Do you need help decoding this riddle? 
>> [12] > 1/2 - Marcus
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh, what do we have here? A treasure tied to Pluto Nash? The absurdity of it all! This is going to be a fun day!
>> [3] > 2/3 - David, Marcus
:: David : cautiously : Hey Marcus, I overheard something about a treasure riddle? What's the deal? 
:: Marcus : dramatically : Ah, my good friend! Gather 'round and let me regale you with the tale of the cryptic riddle and the hidden treasure that lies in wait, tied to a most peculiar film of yesteryear!
>> [7] > 1/2 - Devika
:: Devika : pondering : Pluto Nash, huh? Sounds like a wild goose chase. But hidden treasures are always fun. I wonder what this mysterious riddle is all about...
>> [22] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, David
:: Art : conspiratorially : Alright team, let's get to work on deciphering this riddle. And let's keep this on the down-low; we don't want the whole office chasing after this wild goose.
:: Nia : determined : Agreed. We don't need more chaos than we already have. Let's just focus on solving the riddle and see where it leads us.
:: David : excitedly : I'm in! Who knows, maybe this treasure will be our ticket to early retirement and endless margaritas on the beach! Or at least a good laugh.
>> [20] > 4/6 - Art, Nia, David, Devika
:: Art : excited : Alright, team. I've gathered you here in the party room to discuss a matter of utmost importance. It might just be the key to a hidden treasure. I need your help to decipher this cryptic riddle from "Pluto Nash." 
:: Nia : smirking : Art, when you say "hidden treasure," are we talking about actual riches or just another one of your half-baked schemes for making a quick buck?
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, and besides, "Pluto Nash" is a bit of a deep cut, isn't it? I mean, really, what's next, "Gigli?"
:: Devika : intrigued : Nevertheless, I'm always up for a good puzzle. What does this riddle say exactly?
:: Art : elated : The riddle says, "The key to fortune lies in a word, uttered in darkness by a bird." It's very cryptic, but I'm convinced we can solve it together. But let's keep this on the down-low. We don't want the entire office in on this treasure hunt.
>> [2] > 2/2 - Carmen, Liam
:: Carmen : suspicious : Have you noticed all the hush-hush meetings going on lately? I wonder what Art and the gang are up to.
:: Liam : smug : I bet it's corporate sabotage or something equally nefarious. You know Art, always looking for ways to make a quick buck. 
>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, Rachel, David
:: Marcus : inquisitive : David, buddy, do you have any idea about this "Pluto Nash" treasure hunt? Or is it just another one of Art's ill-conceived schemes?
:: Rachel : curious : Yeah, word around the office is there's something big going on, and we don't want to be left in the dark.
:: David : cryptic : All I can say is that Art's got something up his sleeve, but don't get your hopes up. It could be a wild goose chase - or in our case, a wild Pluto Nash chase.
For this act, create multiple scenes that build up the plot:
>> [15] > 4/5 - Liam, Rachel, Carmen, David
:: Liam : exaggeratedly : Have you heard about the secret meetings happening around the office? Something's going down, and we're not in on it. The rumors are spreading faster than the time I won that hot dog eating contest.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, I'm sure it's as important as your so-called "hot dog eating" contest. But seriously, what could they be up to? Maybe it's a corporate takeover, or, you know, they're just discussing who has the best stapler. 
:: Carmen : jokingly : Or maybe they're forming a cult based on the teachings of an obscure '90s movie. I mean, who wouldn't want to follow the teachings of "Pluto Nash"?
:: David : laughing : Oh yeah, a cult devoted to the almighty Eddie Murphy, with all his wisdom and puns! Seriously though, we should try to find out what's going on before the whole office implodes from all this gossip.
>> [18] > 3/3 - Samantha, Marko, Devika
:: Samantha : seriously : I'm telling you, it's a sabotage attempt. They're up to something, and we need to be on our guard.
:: Marko : jokingly : Or maybe they're just trying to find the best hiding spot for a treasure hunt! I mean, who wouldn't want to search the office for hidden loot?
:: Devika : distractedly : Guys, let's not get carried away. It's probably just a new project they're discussing. No need to get paranoid about sabotage or treasure hunts.
>> [16] > 5/7 - Arthur, Nia, Marcus, David, Devika
:: Arthur : reluctantly : Alright, listen up. We've been decoding a cryptic riddle tied to the movie "Pluto Nash" for a hidden treasure. I know it sounds absurd, but I couldn't resist the potential payoff.
:: Nia : sternly : Art, you should have been more transparent with the team. Now everyone is on edge and jumping to wild conclusions.
:: Marcus : playfully : Well, on the bright side, we now have everyone's attention. So, why not join forces and solve this riddle together as a team?
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, we'll either find an actual treasure or just have one heck of a story to tell at the next office party.
:: Devika : confused : Well, I guess we're in this together now. Let's get to work and crack this riddle wide open. May the wisdom of "Pluto Nash" be with us!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Nia, David, Marcus
:: Art : excited : Alright team, this riddle has been driving us nuts all day! Let's try to figure it out once and for all. Maybe we should start off by analyzing each word and see if we can find any patterns or hidden meanings.
:: Nia : sarcastically : Art, I've been trying to decipher this riddle for hours. Word by word, phrase by phrase, it's like it's just taunting me! It's honestly making me question my own sanity at this point.
:: David : chuckling : I'm no riddleologist, but I've got an idea. What if we try to look at it from a different perspective, like upside down or something? Maybe there's a hidden message only visible to those who aren't afraid to think... "upside downwards"?
:: Marcus : grinning : David, you never cease to amaze me with your out-of-the-box thinking. If we can't solve this riddle right-side-up, maybe we should flip it on its head! Let's give it a try!
>> [15] > 5/5 - Devika, Rachel, Liam, Carmen, Marko
:: Devika : determined : Okay everyone, I think I may have cracked the code to this riddle. The keyword "Pluto Nash" seems to be the key to unlocking the treasure's location. We just need to figure out how it connects to our office.
:: Rachel : gossiping : You know, I heard from Mike that there's a secret room in our office that nobody knows about. Maybe that's where the treasure is? I mean, it's worth a shot, right?
:: Liam : smirking : Rachel, you little Sherlock Holmes, you might be onto something! If there's a secret room, then it's only fitting that it holds a secret treasure. Let's gather the others and make our way there.
:: Carmen : excited : Oh, this is thrilling! I've always wanted to go on an adventure in the office. I'm in, let's find that treasure!
:: Marko : laughing : Alright mates, let's go treasure hunting! And hey, if we come up empty, at least we had a good laugh today!
>> [6] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : nervous : Alright, Devika, are we sure that the treasure is in the secret room? I mean, what if it's a trap? Or worse, what if there's no treasure at all?
:: Nia : reassuring : Art, we've come this far, and it's clear that the riddle led us here for a reason. Plus, you're the one who started this whole quest, remember? We're all in this together now. Let's see it through.
:: Devika : confident : Art, trust me, we're onto something here. I can feel it in my bones. Let's round up the others and finally put an end to this wild goose chase. I'm sure it will all be worth it in the end.
>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Marcus, Liam
:: David : excited : Guys, Devika says she's cracked the code and the treasure is in the secret room! We should gather up everyone and prepare for the grand reveal.
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : Oh, this is going to be grand! I can't wait to see what's inside that secret room. It's like we're in a movie or something! Let's go find the rest of the gang.
:: Liam : grinning : Yeah, whether it's treasure or just some dusty old junk, I'm sure this is going to be a story to remember. Let's not waste any more time!
>> [18] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : excited : Gather 'round, everyone! It's time to unveil the treasure that has eluded us for so long, and that has led us on this wild goose chase of misadventures and accidents!
:: Nia : sarcastic : Oh, joyous day! We stand united in our quest for this grand treasure, which I'm sure won't be a letdown after everything we've been through. Let's just hope it's worth it.
:: Marcus : grinning : Fear not, my fellow truth-seekers! For if there's one thing we Oddballs are known for, it's finding hilarity and meaning in even the most mundane of discoveries. Shall we proceed?
>> [6] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, David
>> [20] > 3/6 - Devika, Carmen, Liam
:: Art : opening the door : Behold, the company's secret room and the place where the treasure awaits! I suppose we should take a moment to thank Devika for her ingenious decryption skills.
:: Devika : modest : Aww, shucks, Art. It was just a bit of code-cracking. But seriously, what could be better than finding treasure in our very own office? 
:: Carmen : excited : I can't believe we're finally here! I'm sure whatever we find will be worth it, even if it's just a little token in our everyday Oddball lives.
:: Liam : chuckling : Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'll be satisfied with anything that makes our daily grind a bit more interesting—even if it's just a bunch of candy vending tokens.
>> [20] > 5/6 - Art, Nia, Marcus, David, Devika, Carmen
:: Art : revealing the tokens : Behold, the treasure we've all been waiting for! Candy vending tokens galore!
:: Nia : surprised : Of all the things it could have been... candy vending tokens? I must admit, I did not see that coming.
:: Marcus : amused : See? I told you we'd find hilarity in the unexpected. If nothing else, these tokens may not be worth much, but they'll certainly make for a sweet story to tell.
:: David : laughing : You've got to admit, this whole wild adventure has certainly added some flavor to our office lives. Pun intended, of course.
:: Devika : eager : So, what are we waiting for? Let's all grab a token and enjoy a little treat like the Oddballs we are!
