>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Liam
:: Marcus : chuckling : Can you believe the chaos we've created in the office? If we can keep the owner distracted for just a bit longer, we might actually pull this off!
:: David : nervously : I hope we don't get caught before Nia and Marko finish their mission. My job description didn't include "office carnival mastermind."
:: Liam : smirking : Mate, the way I see it, the more ridiculous we can make this, the better our chances of saving the secret bar. So, just embrace the madness!

>> [22] > Nia, Marko
:: Nia : whispering : Marko, we need to find the legal documents that can help us convince the owner not to take any action against us.
:: Marko : whispering back : Crikey, Nia, this is like something straight out of a spy movie! We've got this, just keep an eye out for any surprises.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Samantha, Art, Building Owner
:: Art : feigning innocence : Mr. Owner, sir, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Our office is always this... spirited.
:: Samantha : trying to keep a straight face : Yes, we're just multitasking as we're working, mixing business with a little bit of pleasure.
:: Building Owner : suspicious : Something's fishy around here. I'll get to the bottom of this, mark my words!

>> [15] > 4/5 - Rachel, Devika, Carmen, David
:: Rachel : giddy : I can't believe how our perfectly bizarre office carnival is bringing everyone together! Let's hope it effectively distracts the owner from our real objective.
:: Carmen : excitedly : I haven't had this much fun at work since... well, ever! The only thing missing is a piñata.
:: Devika : smirking : You're right, Carmen! Nothing says "odd" like whacking a piñata while discussing the latest software updates. 
:: David : trying to contain his laughter : Guys, I just saw Liam juggling staplers while giving a sales pitch! This is absolute madness, and I love it!

>> [11] > 2/4 - Arthur, Building Owner
:: Art : pleading : You must understand, sir, these shenanigans are simply an attempt to improve morale and productivity. No ill intentions whatsoever!
:: Building Owner : softening : Alright, I must admit, it's kind of hilarious. Just make sure things don't get too out of hand. And keep that secret bar under wraps.

== The Oddball employees' plan seems to be working, as the office-wide carnival of absurdity succeeds in distracting the building owner while Nia and Marko work on their covert mission. The owner catches on to the chaos, but is unexpectedly amused by the employees' wacky antics. He ultimately agrees to let the secret bar continue operating as long as it doesn't get out of control. The employees celebrate their victory with quirky cocktails and newfound camaraderie.
