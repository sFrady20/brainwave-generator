title: The Oddball Redemption
exposition: Art discovers a long-forgotten passageway leading from Oddball Industries' storage room to a secret dive bar underneath the building. Excited by his astonishing discovery, Art starts spending more time in the secret bar, mesmerized by the old-time charm and quirky cocktails.

rising action: As more employees become aware of the secret bar, the establishment hits its peak. Art is now known as the "Hallway Highballer" and his relationships with employees become better as over-spiked beverages fuel screwball interactions around the secret watering hole. In some drunken discussions at the bar, the employees brainstorm wild ideas for the company – completely bizarre, yet ingenious.

climax: Just as things are looking up and the newfound camaraderie was starting to impact the morale and productivity of oddball industries, the building's owner then discovers the bizarre underground secret and threatens legal action against Oddball Industries. Desperate to retain control over the company, Art enlists everyone's help to save the traditional treasure.

falling action: Employees launch a two-part chaotic plan. Smokescreen tactics ensue, causing epic shenanigans in the public-facing side of Oddball Industries that distract the owner while covert mission assist in saving the hidden bar operate underground.

resolution: The elaborate two-fold plan seemingly works, just as things start to escalate out of control for developers. In the end, while the owner catches the employees red-handed during one of the operations, they inadvertently make him laugh so hard with their ludicrous antics, he affectionately agrees to keep their boozy secret safe, and everyone celebrates over ridiculously named, creative cocktails.
