>> [11] > 3/4 - Art, Liam, Carmen
:: Art : excited : Alright, team, it's time to pull off the wildest office carnival extravaganza! We'll get the owner so distracted, he won't know what hit him!
:: Liam : overly-enthusiastic : Art, I've got this genius idea - extreme office chair races! We'll make a crazy obstacle course and have everyone racing around like lunatics!
:: Carmen : mischievously : And we can have bizarre food stands all around, like deep-fried pickles and bacon-wrapped bananas! People won't know if they're coming or going!

>> [15] > 4/5 - Marcus, Rachel, David, Devika
:: Marcus : dramatically : I propose we hold the most absurd karaoke contest known to man. Singing in languages we don't even understand, and doing wild interpretive dances!
:: Rachel : gossip-loving : Oh, you know what would be even crazier? Making everyone dress up as their favorite internet meme while doing it! Imagine Art singing his heart out as a confused math lady!
:: David : laughing : Ha! I can already see the cringe! Alright, I'm in! Let's turn this office carnival into the meme-pocalypse!
:: Devika : scatterbrained : Wait, where did I put those LED hula hoops? Oh, found them! Let's make a dark room filled with glow-in-the-dark stuff and hula hoop madness!

>> [18] > 2/3 - Nia, Marko
:: Nia : business-jargon : Alright, Marko, time to circle back and touch base on our plan for the underground covert mission. This better be the smoothest operation in Oddball history!
:: Marko : storyteller : Crikey, no worries, Nia! I've got this top-secret tunnel map from the 1800s that leads straight to the secret bar! It'll be a piece of cake!

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Samantha
:: Art : nervously : Samantha, I've entrusted you with the most important task of all: keeping the building owner busy with our wild carnival antics while we save the hidden bar!
:: Samantha : tough-but-fair : Don't worry, Art, I'll make sure he's so bamboozled, he won't even remember why he came here in the first place!

>> [20] > 3/6 - Liam, Carmen, David
:: Liam : risk-taker : Time to put our carnival master plan into action! Remember, we need to cause maximum chaos to distract the owner! 
:: Carmen : energetic : Let's get this party started! I've got the bacon-wrapped bananas ready to go!
:: David : clumsy : And I'm, uh, just trying not to trip over anything while setting up the karaoke machine! 

== In this act, Oddball Industries employees successfully launch their two-part chaotic plan to distract the building owner and save their secret bar. They turn the office into a bizarre, meme-fueled carnival with outlandish games, strange food, and wild karaoke contests. Meanwhile, Nia and Marko embark on a covert mission to ensure the hidden bar's safety. Samantha is tasked with keeping the owner occupied amidst the office-wide shenanigans.
