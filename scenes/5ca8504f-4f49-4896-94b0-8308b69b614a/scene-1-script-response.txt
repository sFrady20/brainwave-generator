>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, David
:: Liam : excited : Mate, have you seen those bizarre printer messages popping up like kangaroos in a field? I reckon it's some sort of alien communication!
:: David : chuckling : You think so, Liam? Maybe it's just some higher-up's way of telling us that our coffee breaks are too long, in a language we can't understand.

>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Carmen, Marcus
:: David : puzzled : Seriously though, what do you guys think about these messages? I can't shake the feeling that something's going on.
:: Carmen : teasingly : You mean like an underground extraterrestrial dance party in the basement? Hilarious!
:: Marcus : dramatically : Or perhaps it's a secret government experiment hidden in our printers! We're all guinea pigs in their twisted game!

>> [9] > 3/3 - Art, Marko, Mike
:: Art : yawning : Gentlemen, I was just informed by these tall fellas in suits that there is a classified project going on here. But don't worry, it's all under control.
:: Marko : jokingly : Oh, so it's you who invited the Men in Black, then? Wait, are they making a new movie? Can I be in it?
:: Mike : sarcastically : Sure, Marko. You can apply to be an alien extra. Maybe you'll get to meet Will Smith!

>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Devika, Rachel
:: Nia : suspicious : So, I heard Art met with those men in black. What do you think they're up to?
:: Devika : casually : Maybe they're here to fix the air conditioning. It's been wonky lately.
:: Rachel : dramatically : Or they're here to take over the company! We'll all be replaced by robots and sent to Mars!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Carmen, Marcus
:: Liam : whispering : I've got it! It's a treasure map! The encrypted messages are clues to find a hidden gold stash right here in the office!
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Of course, Liam, because finding hidden treasure is a totally normal thing to happen at work.
:: Marcus : playfully : Well, if it's true, I call dibs on the treasure! Let's start our very own Oddball pirate crew!
