>> [20] > 3/6 - Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : overjoyed : Well, mates, I can't believe that plan actually worked! Who'd have thought our ridiculous alien rescue performance would drive the men in black away?
:: David : chuckling : I know, right? It's like our collective insanity has become our greatest weapon! Although, I'm sure Devika's handy programming skills and Marko's flair for special effects didn't hurt either.
:: Carmen : grinning : Isn't it great how we can always turn our weirdness into something useful? It just goes to show that being "normal" is overrated. It's all about embracing the madness, baby!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Devika, Rachel
:: Nia : amused : Devika, you truly outdid yourself with that prank. Creating an obscure programming language just for fun? That's some next-level nerdiness. I can't help but be a little impressed.
:: Devika : proudly : Thank you, Nia. I have to admit, I never expected my little project would wind up saving the day. But hey, sometimes you just have to let your inner geek run wild!
:: Liam : jokingly : You should patent that language, Devika. Who knows? Maybe "Funkytoad-72" will become the next big thing in computer programming.
:: Rachel : laughing : Oh, the possibilities! We could start a whole industry around it! "Oddball Language Inc., bringing Funkytoad-72 to the masses!"

>> [19] > 1/3 - Art
:: Art : musing : Well, that was an unexpected turn of events. But I suppose it's all part of life at Oddball Industries. We have our quirks, our eccentricities, and our unique talents. And somehow, against all odds, they all come together to make this place what it is: a family of oddballs, united by our shared love for the strange and the absurd. 

== In this act, the employees successfully record and spread their absurd alien rescue performance around the company's bulletin, which distracts the mysterious men in black. The prank turns out to be a clever ruse by Devika, who created an obscure programming language in her free time. The characters express their surprise and amusement at the unexpected turn of events and celebrate their victory over the mysterious situation. Ultimately, Devika names her new language "Funkytoad-72" as Oddball Industries returns to its bizarre version of normalcy.
