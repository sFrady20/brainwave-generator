>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, David, Marcus
:: Rachel : confused : Wow, what's up with these printers? It's like they're all spitting out some sort of secret code!
:: David : joking : Maybe we've stumbled upon a hidden treasure map or something even more bizarre like the blueprints to an alien spaceship! Can you imagine that? We could become intergalactic explorers!
:: Marcus : laughing : You, my friend, have been watching way too many conspiracy documentaries. But seriously, it's strange, isn't it? I mean, what are the odds of all printers in the office having the same glitch at the same time?

>> [18] > 2/3 - Liam, Carmen
:: Liam : curiously : Hey Carmen, have you noticed those weird dudes in black suits roaming around the office? It's like we've got a pack of secret agents among us.
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Oh yeah, they're definitely up to something! Maybe they're here to save us from Devika's mad experiments, or they're lost in the wrong building. You never know with this place.

>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : concerned : Art, the printers are going haywire, and there are some shady characters walking around. Should I be worried?
:: Art : dismissively : Ah, don't worry about it. It's probably just a glitch. As for the men in black, they're likely just some corporate goons dropping in for an unannounced audit. Trust me, we've seen weirder things happen around here.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Devika, Rachel, David, Marcus
:: Devika : excitedly : Guys, I've been analyzing these printer pages, and they seem to be written in an entirely new coding language! It's absolutely bonkers!
:: Rachel : skeptically : You're telling me that the printers are creating their own secret language? That's one heck of an office prank!
:: David : grinning : But wait, there's more! We've got the men in black, too! It's like a full-blown conspiracy theory come to life. I bet Art's in on it. The Oddball Industries Illuminati, maybe?
:: Marcus : chuckling : If that's the case, we'd better keep our eyes peeled and our tinfoil hats ready. You never know when we'll need them!
