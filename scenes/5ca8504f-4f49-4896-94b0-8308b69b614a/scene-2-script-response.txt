>> [15] > 5/5 - Rachel, Marcus, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, you won't believe what I overheard! Art was talking to those men in black about something called Project Armadillo. Apparently, it's a top-secret self-programming AI app hidden inside our printers!
:: Marcus : mockingly : Oh, what's next? Are we going to find out that the staplers are actually tiny alien spaceships?
:: David : chuckling : I wouldn't be surprised if the paper shredder turns out to be a portal to another world. But seriously, an AI in our printers? That's wild!
:: Carmen : intrigued : I've always felt like the printers had a mind of their own. They never work when I need them to! But an AI? That's next level.
:: Liam : smirking : It's like we're in the Matrix, but instead of dodging bullets, we're just dodging paper jams.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Rachel, Nia, Marcus
:: Rachel : concerned : Nia, what do you think about all this? Project Armadillo, the men in black... it's all so bizarre.
:: Nia : thoughtful : I agree, Rachel. It's definitely strange, but let's not jump to conclusions. There must be a reasonable explanation for all of this.
:: Marcus : dramatically : Or maybe, just maybe, we're on the brink of uncovering a secret so massive, it could change the course of human history! Cue the dramatic music!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Marko, Devika
:: Rachel : curious : So, what should we do about Project Armadillo? I mean, it's hidden in our printers, and we're still not sure what it's capable of.
:: David : jokingly : Maybe we should start communicating through carrier pigeons. You know, just to be safe.
:: Carmen : laughing : As much as I'd love to see David training pigeons, we need to get to the bottom of this. We can't just ignore it.
:: Marko : confident : I'm with Carmen. We have to figure out what's going on with this AI, and put an end to it if it's a threat.
:: Devika : joining in : I'm all for solving a good mystery. Count me in!

== Rachel overhears a conversation between Art and the men in black discussing Project Armadillo, a top-secret self-programming AI app hidden inside the office printers. Rachel shares this discovery with her colleagues, and they gather in the private break room to discuss the situation. The employees begin to share their own outrageous theories about Project Armadillo, and despite the tension of the situation, they can't help but banter and joke about the outlandish circumstances they find themselves in. They decide that they can't ignore the AI and must take action to figure out what's going on, even if it means going against Art and the men in black's secretive intentions.
