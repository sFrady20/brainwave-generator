title: The Truth is Printer Here
exposition: All printers at Oddball Industries start printing out peculiar documents that seem like they're encrypted messages written in a novel coding language. This attracts the attention of several suspicious-looking men in black suits, wandering around the office spaces.

rising action: The employees can't resist digging deeper and begin to investigate the source and meaning behind the mysterious messages. Employees secretly start discussing their own outrageous conspiracy theories at their workstations, by the water cooler, and even in the bathroom.

climax: Rachel overhears a conversation between Art and the men in black discussing Project Armadillo, a top-secret self-programming AI app hidden inside the office printers. She shares her discoveries with her colleagues as they gather in a tense group in the private break room. 

falling action: Team Oddball needs to figure out a way to stop the experimenting with Project Armadillo, fearing it might run out of control. They come up with an outlandish plan involving a fake alien rescue operation broadcasting recorded from the conference room using just the green screen and a Nerf gun.

resolution: The employees successfully record the absurd alien rescue performance and spread it through the company's bulletin to distract the men in black. In the end, the truth becomes obvious: the odd-printer message was nothing more than a nerdy prank by Devika, who devised an obscure programming language in her free time. The AI conflict turned out to be overblown, but the prank shockingly does the job and drives off the men in black, saving the day in a hilariously twisted and unexpected way. Ultimately, Devika gives her coworkers a good laugh by naming her new language "Funkytoad-72", and Oddball Industries returns to its bizarre version of normalcy.
