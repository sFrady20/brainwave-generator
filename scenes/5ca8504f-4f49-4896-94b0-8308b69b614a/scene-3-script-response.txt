>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Carmen, David, Marcus
:: Nia : serious : Alright guys, we need to come up with a plan to stop Project Armadillo before it gets out of control. Any ideas?
:: Carmen : excited : Ooh, I've got a doozy! What if we stage a fake alien rescue operation to throw the men in black off our scent? We could broadcast it from a hidden location!
:: David : amused : Carmen, that is so ludicrous, it might actually work. I mean, we've got the green screen in the conference room, and I could dig up a Nerf gun from somewhere...
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh, this is bonkers! Who needs logic when we've got unfathomable absurdity on our side? I'm in!

>> [10] > 3/3 - David, Marko, Devika
:: David : grinning : Marko, Devika, we've got a mission for you. We're going to stage a fake alien rescue operation to distract the men in black. We need your creative minds to make this the most ridiculous and unbelievable spectacle ever. Can you help us out?
:: Marko : enthusiastic : Haha, David, have you seen my latest pet goldfish escapades video? I've been itching to put those special effects skills to good use! Count me in, mate!
:: Devika : intrigued : Brilliant! I can't resist dabbling in this kind of madness. I'll help you guys create a strange alien language for the broadcast, just for an extra touch of weirdness. Funkytoad-72 has prepared me for this!

>> [16] > 6/7 - Nia, Carmen, David, Marcus, Marko, Devika
:: Nia : motivated : Alright team, we've got our plan in action. Let's gather in the conference room and make this alien rescue happen. Remember, the weirder, the better!
:: David : joking : So, like, green alien cats chasing a giant Nerf gun through space while speaking in Funkytoad-72? 
:: Marcus : laughing : David, that's so absurd, it's almost beautiful! We'll be pioneers of intergalactic tomfoolery! 
:: Carmen : excited : This is going to be epic! Let's get to work, everyone, and remember, keep it fresh and ridiculous!
:: Marko : confident : You got it, Carmen! Trust us, this will be the most mind-bogglingly bizarre thing this office has ever seen.
:: Devika : playful : Just wait till you see the language I've prepared. It'll make Funkytoad-72 look like baby talk!
