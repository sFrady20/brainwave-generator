>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Marcus, Carmen
:: David : embarrassed : So, uhm, about that treasure... turns out it was just a software training video I was trying to promote. I had no idea it would spiral so out of control.
:: Marcus : chuckling : David my friend, you've unintentionally sparked the most fun and ridiculous adventure this office has ever seen! It was a wild ride, and I'm sure we'll have plenty of stories to tell for years to come.
:: Carmen : grinning : Oh, David, you beautiful bumbling babe of a man! That was some of the weirdest and wackiest fun we've ever had. Turns out, we don't need a legendary treasure to feel like a million bucks.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Rachel, Liam, Marko
:: Nia : amused : In a bizarre way, this whole treasure hunt brought us all closer together. The bonds we formed, the teamwork we displayed, and the absurdity we endured—that's the real treasure right there.
:: Rachel : giggling : Yeah, who knew we could bond over something so ridiculous? And hey, at least we got some software training out of it!
:: Liam : smirking : Absolutely! We’ve all gained something from this experience, beyond just the software knowledge. Heck, I've discovered that I need to improve my interpretive dance skills for our next "team building" endeavor.
:: Marko : laughing : Oh, mate! Your dancing nearly gave me a heart attack! But I must admit, it was quite a sight to behold.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Devika, Mike, Sam, Michael
:: Art : content : Oddball Industries is truly a unique and special place. I am proud that we all came together in such an extraordinary way, and I can't wait to see what other adventures we might embark on.
:: Devika : thoughtful : And the best part is that we all learned more about ourselves and each other during this journey. It's those connections that will keep us strong as a team.
:: Mike : agreeing : That's right! We may be oddballs, but we're oddballs with heart. I've never felt closer to you all than I do right now.
:: Sam : reluctantly smiling : I suppose I must admit, even I had a bit of fun during this treasure hunting fiasco. Just don't get used to it, I need to maintain my tough image.
:: Michael : chuckling : Oh, don't worry, Sam. We know you're all soft on the inside, like a marshmallow!
