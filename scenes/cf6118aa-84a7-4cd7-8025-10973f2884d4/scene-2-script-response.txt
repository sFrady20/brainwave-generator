>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Rachel, Liam
:: David : nervously : Guys, I have to confess something. I made up the treasure story without realizing the whole office would go into a frenzy. I just wanted to make the software training video sound more appealing, but now the rumor has gotten way out of hand.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Ahh, David the "treasure-maker"! You sure got us all going on a wild goose chase, didn't you? It's been hilarious, though. I can't believe so many people bought into it.
:: Liam : chuckling : Come on, David. It's all in good fun. Who knew your clumsy storytelling could ignite such excitement in this office? If anything, it's brought everyone closer together... and made for some unforgettable laughs.

>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Sam
:: Nia : strategizing : Alright, ladies, given that our treasure hunt has turned out to be a sham, we should use this newfound energy and camaraderie to our advantage. Let's brainstorm ways to improve office productivity or perhaps organize a team-building retreat. No treasure hunt, no problem!
:: Carmen : cheerfully : I agree! Let's turn this treasure-hunt fiasco into a memorable team experience. We could go on a real treasure hunt or an escape room to bond even more as a team.
:: Sam : seriously : That's not too bad of an idea, and we could even invite a cat, just to push my boundaries. Who wouldn't want to watch hilarity ensue as I struggle to stay brave in the presence of a kitty?

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Marko, Devika, Art
:: Marcus : inspired : Hey, team! So, it turns out the treasure was just a software training video. You know what, though? It doesn't mean we can't find real treasures within our little Oddball family, like hidden talents or untold stories! Let's uncover our own personal treasures!
:: Marko : jokingly : Oh, I've got a treasure for you! Did I ever tell you about the time I found a treasure map inside a fortune cookie? Turns out it led me to the best sushi place in town. Crazy, right?
:: Devika : dreamily : I remember discovering a treasure: When I first learned programming, it felt like a whole new world full of endless possibilities. That's my personal treasure that I carry with me every day.
:: Art : sentimentally : Ah, you guys are great. Who needs a physical treasure when we have the treasure of friendship and laughter right here in our office? Besides, Oddball Industries itself is a treasure, isn't it?
