:: Rachel : enthusiastic : Oh, I'm ready for this treasure hunt! I'll be the connection queen, and no intel will escape me!
:: Marko : amused : Crikey! I'm excited, Nia, but just don't expect me to remember every little detail. I might need a reminder or two, but we'll crack those riddles like eggs!
:: Carmen : competitive : Alright, Team One, let's show them what we've got! Marcus, you and I are a force to be reckoned with! And Sam, your security expertise will definitely give us the edge we need.

>> [2] > 2/2 - David, Liam
:: David : worried : Liam, I've got to admit, I'm getting a bit nervous about this whole treasure hunt thing. What if people find out I accidentally started the rumor? They're going to think I'm an absolute idiot!
:: Liam : smirking : Well, mate, if the shoe fits... Nah, just kidding! Look, even if they find out, we're all having a good time with this treasure hunt. It's probably the most fun we've had at work in ages! So, don't stress about it. Let's just enjoy the ride!

>> [8] > 3/3 - Nia, Marko, Rachel

:: Rachel : scheming : Oh, I'll get Art talking, all right! He won't know what hit him!
:: Marko : distracted : Speaking of hitting things, did you guys hear about that time I was playing cricket and the ball hit me right in the face? It was hilarious! I've got a picture somewhere...
:: Nia : impatient : Marko, focus! We're on a treasure hunt, remember? Keep your stories for another time.
