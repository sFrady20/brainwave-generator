>> [16] > 5/7 - Art, David, Nia, Rachel, Marcus
:: Art : chuckling : Alright, team! I never thought I'd say this, but our mission is to locate the Mystical Salad Spinner of Lore. Let's put our heads together and brainstorm some positively ridiculous strategies.
:: David : grinning : I heard from a guy who knows a guy that there's a black market for kitchen appliances. It's said that they have the rarest of items... like toasters that can cook a perfect medium-rare steak!
:: Nia : smirking : Oh, David, really? Well, how about we infiltrate competing companies and snoop around their kitchens? Maybe one of them is hiding the elusive salad spinner...
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Or, we could always post an ad on social media saying we lost our magical salad spinner and wait to see if someone claims they found it.
:: Marcus : laughing : Yes, and let's not forget the possibility of a secret underground salad spinner collector's club! We'll need a secret handshake and a code phrase like "The lettuce has been spun."

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Liam, Carmen
:: Art : amused : Alright, Liam, Carmen, we need more outlandish ideas. The crazier, the better!
:: Liam : smirking : What if we pose as international salad spinner inspectors? We could go from company to company, demanding to see all their salad spinners under the guise of "quality control"!
:: Carmen : giggling : That's rich! How about we create a wild goose chase, planting salad spinner-related clues around the city, and make our competitors think they're onto something big? It'd be like an epic spinner scavenger hunt!
