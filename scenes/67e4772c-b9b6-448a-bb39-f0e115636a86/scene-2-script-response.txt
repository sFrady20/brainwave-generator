>> [5] > 3/3 - Liam, Carmen, David
:: Liam : excited : So guys, I've been brainstorming ideas on how to get the Mystical Salad Spinner, right? And I've got the perfect plan. We do some guerilla marketing dressed as crop circle farmers online.
:: David : chuckling : Liam, you can't be serious. That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard, but it's also kind of brilliant. What's the strategy here, mate?
:: Liam : grinning : Trust me, David. We create social media profiles as these crop circle farmers claiming to have the spinner or be in search of it. We'll create a buzz, trick businesses into admitting they have it or want it too, and then we strike! It's foolproof.

:: Carmen : laughing : You guys wouldn't believe the plan Liam came up with to find the Mystical Salad Spinner. He wants us to become crop circle farmers on social media and use guerilla marketing tactics. It's so ridiculous yet hilarious!
:: Rachel : giggling : That's just insane enough to work. I can already imagine the memes and witty banter between companies. I'm totally on board!
:: Art : amused : Ha! That's so outlandish, it might just work. And if anything, it'll be a morale booster and bring some laughs around the office.
:: Nia : smirking : Well, as long as it doesn't interfere with our real work, I say let's do it. Go forth, Oddball Industries, and conquer the salad spinner world!

:: Mike : grinning : Count me in! I can't wait to see the look on our competitors' faces when they realize they've been duped by a bunch of crop circle-loving salad spinner fanatics.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Carmen, Rachel, David
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : So, the first step of our crop circle farmer infiltration has begun! How's everyone's social media profiles coming along?
:: Carmen : chuckling : Mine's great. I'm posing as "Farmer Sal A. D. Spinner" and I already have a few followers. This is too much fun!
:: Rachel : excited : I've got "Spinny McSpinface" going on here, and I'll be posting cryptic messages about the spinner's whereabouts.
:: David : laughing : You guys are killing it! I'm going to be "Circler the Salad Sorcerer" - I've even got a trendy wizard hat in my profile picture. Let's get this party started!
