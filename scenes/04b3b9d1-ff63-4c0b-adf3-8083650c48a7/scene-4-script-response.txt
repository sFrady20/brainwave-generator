>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Sam, Rachel
:: Nia : serious : Alright, we've gathered enough evidence to prove Art's innocence in this absurd conspiracy theory. We need to put an end to this chaos before it spirals out of control.
:: Liam : jokingly : You mean to tell me that Art isn't secretly controlling the world from his office? What a bummer, I was ready to ask him for a promotion!
:: Sam : deadpan : Real funny, Liam. But seriously, this is getting ridiculous. We need to confront Rachel and the rest of her... believers.
:: Rachel : defensive : Hey, I'm right here, you know! And for the record, it's not like I'm the only one who got swept up in this conspiracy. Besides, it's kind of fun to think that our mundane office life has some hidden intrigue. Even if it turns out Art is just terrible at making coffee.

>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Carmen, Marcus
:: David : chuckling : Can you believe all this Illuminati nonsense? I mean, I can hardly imagine Art even knowing how to pronounce "Illuminati."
:: Carmen : laughing : I know, right? But you got to admit, it's made the office a whole lot more interesting lately. It's like we're in our very own spy movie!
:: Marcus : grinning : A thrilling tale of deception, secret societies and... coffee machines! I might just write a screenplay about this!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Nia, Liam, Sam, Rachel, Art
:: Nia : determined : Alright, it's time for an intervention. Rachel, you and your fellow conspiracy enthusiasts need to know the truth. Art is not a part of the Illuminati.
:: Liam : smirking : Behold, our extensive evidence! Exhibit A: Art's inability to work a coffee machine. Exhibit B: His constant naps during meetings. Not exactly the traits of a world-controlling mastermind, huh?
:: Sam : stern : We need to put an end to this madness before it completely derails the office.
:: Rachel : sheepish : I guess you're right. I might have let my imagination get the best of me. Sorry, Art.
:: Art : chuckling : Apology accepted, Rachel. I'm just glad I'm not responsible for some secret organization. I already have enough on my plate here at Oddball Industries!
