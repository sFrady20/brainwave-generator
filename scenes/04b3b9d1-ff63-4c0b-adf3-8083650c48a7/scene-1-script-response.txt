>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, you won't believe what I found last night! I stumbled upon this conspiracy website, and it has me convinced that Art is a part of the Illuminati! I mean, think about it. He's the CEO of a successful software company, he's been around for years, and he always wears that weird ring!
:: Marcus : sarcastic : Oh, Rachel, you're really onto something now! I bet he has secret meetings with lizard people at the top of Mount Everest.
:: David : chuckling : Well, if Art's a part of the Illuminati, then I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you! In all seriousness, that website must be a goldmine for laughs. I'm almost tempted to check it out.
:: Carmen : amused : Rachel, you should be a detective or something! But seriously, this is just good old office gossip-worthy fun. Keep digging for clues, Sherlock Holmes! And let us know if you find a secret passage to an underground lair.

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Marko
:: Devika : intrigued : Hey, Marko! Rachel's got this wild theory about Art being in the Illuminati. I was thinking, what if we went through the company's source code and look for any hidden messages or symbols? It could be a fun little project to break the monotony.
:: Marko : grinning : Oh, that's brilliant, Devika! We could find some obscure functions or variables and create a conspiracy chart! I'm in! Let's get this operation started and see if we can uncover any secrets hidden within Oddball Industries!

>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, Nia
:: Liam : smirking : Hey Nia, did you hear about Rachel's latest obsession? She thinks Art's part of the Illuminati, which is just insane! I mean, I knew she liked a little drama, but this is next level stuff.
:: Nia : laughing : Yeah, I heard about it. It's completely ridiculous, but I have to admit, it's a nice change of pace from the usual office gossip. As long as it doesn't interfere with work, let them have their fun. Who knows, maybe we'll all end up with some good stories to tell at the next office party.

== In this act, Rachel's conspiracy theory about Art reaches new heights, as her coworkers indulge her antics with a mix of disbelief and morbid curiosity. Devika and Marko join the fun by searching the company's source code and creating elaborate conspiracy charts to fuel the fire. However, other coworkers, like Liam and Nia, find it amusing but understand the ridiculousness of the situation. As the conspiracy theory grows, the atmosphere in the office becomes even more bizarre and fun-loving.
