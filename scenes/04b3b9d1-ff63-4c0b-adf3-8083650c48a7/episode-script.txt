>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Rachel : nervously : Guys, I've stumbled upon something big. This conspiracy website claims that our own CEO, Art Beecham, is a part of the Illuminati! Look at these connections they've drawn between him and this secret organization. It's insane!
:: David : smirking : Rachel, you've been staring at that website so much, you're starting to grow a tin-foil hat. Come on, Art? That old goof? You've gotta admit, that's a bit far-fetched.
:: Carmen : grinning : I don't know, David. It could explain why Art is so secretive about his personal life. Maybe Rachel's onto something! This could be an adventure like no other.
:: Rachel : determined : I'm going to get to the bottom of this. I'll uncover every secret in this office and expose Art's dark past. You'll see!
>> [3] > 2/3 - David, Marcus
:: David : laughing : Marcus, guess what? Rachel's gone off the deep end, she thinks Art is a member of the Illuminati!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh, that's rich! Art can't even figure out how to use the coffee machine, let alone control the world from behind the scenes. But you know what? I say we let her have her fun. We could all use a little excitement around here.
>> [7] > 1/2 - Devika
:: Devika : thinking aloud : If Art is involved in some secret society, maybe there are clues hidden in the company's source code! Time to do a little digging.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Liam, Nia, Michael
:: Rachel : whispering : Guys, listen up! I've discovered something that could blow this whole conspiracy wide open. I found secret symbols hidden in Art's office! We need to investigate further!
:: Liam : sarcastically : Sure, Rachel, maybe he's also in cahoots with the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot.
:: Nia : authoritative : Alright, everyone, let's not get carried away. Rachel, why don't you focus on your actual job and leave the conspiracy theories for your free time?
:: Michael : teasing : Yeah, Rachel, next thing you know, the office printer will be a portal to another dimension.
>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, you won't believe what I found last night! I stumbled upon this conspiracy website, and it has me convinced that Art is a part of the Illuminati! I mean, think about it. He's the CEO of a successful software company, he's been around for years, and he always wears that weird ring!
:: Marcus : sarcastic : Oh, Rachel, you're really onto something now! I bet he has secret meetings with lizard people at the top of Mount Everest.
:: David : chuckling : Well, if Art's a part of the Illuminati, then I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you! In all seriousness, that website must be a goldmine for laughs. I'm almost tempted to check it out.
:: Carmen : amused : Rachel, you should be a detective or something! But seriously, this is just good old office gossip-worthy fun. Keep digging for clues, Sherlock Holmes! And let us know if you find a secret passage to an underground lair.
>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Marko
:: Devika : intrigued : Hey, Marko! Rachel's got this wild theory about Art being in the Illuminati. I was thinking, what if we went through the company's source code and look for any hidden messages or symbols? It could be a fun little project to break the monotony.
:: Marko : grinning : Oh, that's brilliant, Devika! We could find some obscure functions or variables and create a conspiracy chart! I'm in! Let's get this operation started and see if we can uncover any secrets hidden within Oddball Industries!
>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, Nia
:: Liam : smirking : Hey Nia, did you hear about Rachel's latest obsession? She thinks Art's part of the Illuminati, which is just insane! I mean, I knew she liked a little drama, but this is next level stuff.
:: Nia : laughing : Yeah, I heard about it. It's completely ridiculous, but I have to admit, it's a nice change of pace from the usual office gossip. As long as it doesn't interfere with work, let them have their fun. Who knows, maybe we'll all end up with some good stories to tell at the next office party.
>> [6] > 3/3 - Rachel, Carmen, Devika
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, I really think we're onto something big here. We need to act fast before Art's Illuminati agenda takes over the office. We can't let him control us anymore!
:: Carmen : intrigued : I'm not gonna lie, Rachel. I'm still not entirely convinced about this whole conspiracy thing, but it's hard not to get a little caught up in the excitement. So, what's the plan?
:: Devika : mysterious : We've decided to create an impromptu intervention. We'll bring everyone into the conference room, and then we'll confront Art with all our evidence. Surely, he won't be able to deny it then.
>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, Rachel, Marko, Devika, Carmen
:: Marcus : chuckling : Rachel, you've really managed to stir things up around here. I must say, I've never seen the office this... enthusiastic. 
:: Rachel : serious : This is no laughing matter, Marcus. We need to expose Art's secret life before it's too late.
:: Marko : jokingly : Yeah, mate, we're in this together now. We've got to stick it to the man and reveal the truth!
:: Devika : smirking : We've got some pretty convincing evidence, you know. It might be enough to force a confession out of Art.
:: Carmen : smiling : Well, if nothing else, this will definitely go down in Oddball Industries history as one of the most bizarre days ever.
>> [16] > 7/7 - Rachel, Marko, Devika, Art, Marcus, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : determined : Art, we've gathered everyone here today because we have something important to discuss. It's time you come clean about your involvement with the Illuminati. We can't be silent any longer.
:: Art : genuinely baffled : The what now? Illumi-who?
:: Marko : assertive : We've got proof, Art. We know all about your secret meetings and coded messages.
:: Devika : smirking : Yeah, we've cracked your codes, and we know the truth.
:: Marcus : bemused : You know, I wonder what happens in a meeting of the Illuminati? Do they play board games or just sit around talking about world domination?
:: Carmen : laughing : Maybe they have a secret handshake and a special dress code, like robes and sunglasses!
:: Liam : rolling his eyes : This is ridiculous. You guys have really gone off the deep end with this one.
>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Liam, Sam
:: Nia : casually : So, have you two caught wind of Rachel's bizarre theory about Art being involved in some Illuminati conspiracy?
:: Liam : chuckling : Oh, yeah. It's almost as absurd as the time David tried to convince everyone that he could communicate with squirrels.
:: Sam : smirking : You've got to admit, though, it's a nice break from the mundane office chatter, even if it's completely insane.
>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Liam, Sam
:: Nia : concerned : I agree that it's entertaining, but we need to make sure this little conspiracy theory doesn't spiral out of control. The last thing we need is for Art to find out and for the entire office to be labeled as nutcases.
:: Liam : grinning : I have an idea. What if we gather some evidence that disproves their wild theories and present it to them? That way, we can put an end to this madness before it gets out of hand.
:: Sam : nodding : That's a solid plan, Liam. Better to nip this in the bud before Art's reputation is in serious jeopardy.
>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Liam
:: Nia : determined : Okay, Liam, let's start with Art's work history. We can easily disprove their claims by looking into his past projects and showing that there's no way he could be involved in any secret society.
:: Liam : agreeing : That's perfect, Nia. And I'll dig into his charitable work. I bet there's nothing but good deeds and kindness in his past – hardly the stuff of conspiracies.
>> [9] > 2/3 - Liam, Sam
:: Liam : excited : Sam, I found it! Art has been involved in numerous charitable organizations for decades. There's no way someone with such a clean record could be involved in an evil secret society.
:: Sam : smirking : It's time to burst their little conspiracy bubble. Let's gather everyone in the conference room and present our findings.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Sam, Rachel
:: Nia : serious : Alright, we've gathered enough evidence to prove Art's innocence in this absurd conspiracy theory. We need to put an end to this chaos before it spirals out of control.
:: Liam : jokingly : You mean to tell me that Art isn't secretly controlling the world from his office? What a bummer, I was ready to ask him for a promotion!
:: Sam : deadpan : Real funny, Liam. But seriously, this is getting ridiculous. We need to confront Rachel and the rest of her... believers.
:: Rachel : defensive : Hey, I'm right here, you know! And for the record, it's not like I'm the only one who got swept up in this conspiracy. Besides, it's kind of fun to think that our mundane office life has some hidden intrigue. Even if it turns out Art is just terrible at making coffee.
>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Carmen, Marcus
:: David : chuckling : Can you believe all this Illuminati nonsense? I mean, I can hardly imagine Art even knowing how to pronounce "Illuminati."
:: Carmen : laughing : I know, right? But you got to admit, it's made the office a whole lot more interesting lately. It's like we're in our very own spy movie!
:: Marcus : grinning : A thrilling tale of deception, secret societies and... coffee machines! I might just write a screenplay about this!
>> [15] > 5/5 - Nia, Liam, Sam, Rachel, Art
:: Nia : determined : Alright, it's time for an intervention. Rachel, you and your fellow conspiracy enthusiasts need to know the truth. Art is not a part of the Illuminati.
:: Liam : smirking : Behold, our extensive evidence! Exhibit A: Art's inability to work a coffee machine. Exhibit B: His constant naps during meetings. Not exactly the traits of a world-controlling mastermind, huh?
:: Sam : stern : We need to put an end to this madness before it completely derails the office.
:: Rachel : sheepish : I guess you're right. I might have let my imagination get the best of me. Sorry, Art.
:: Art : chuckling : Apology accepted, Rachel. I'm just glad I'm not responsible for some secret organization. I already have enough on my plate here at Oddball Industries!
