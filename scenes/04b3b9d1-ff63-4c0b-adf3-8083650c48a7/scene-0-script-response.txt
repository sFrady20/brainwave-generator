>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Rachel : nervously : Guys, I've stumbled upon something big. This conspiracy website claims that our own CEO, Art Beecham, is a part of the Illuminati! Look at these connections they've drawn between him and this secret organization. It's insane!
:: David : smirking : Rachel, you've been staring at that website so much, you're starting to grow a tin-foil hat. Come on, Art? That old goof? You've gotta admit, that's a bit far-fetched.
:: Carmen : grinning : I don't know, David. It could explain why Art is so secretive about his personal life. Maybe Rachel's onto something! This could be an adventure like no other.
:: Rachel : determined : I'm going to get to the bottom of this. I'll uncover every secret in this office and expose Art's dark past. You'll see!

>> [3] > 2/3 - David, Marcus
:: David : laughing : Marcus, guess what? Rachel's gone off the deep end, she thinks Art is a member of the Illuminati!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh, that's rich! Art can't even figure out how to use the coffee machine, let alone control the world from behind the scenes. But you know what? I say we let her have her fun. We could all use a little excitement around here.

>> [7] > 1/2 - Devika
:: Devika : thinking aloud : If Art is involved in some secret society, maybe there are clues hidden in the company's source code! Time to do a little digging.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Liam, Nia, Michael
:: Rachel : whispering : Guys, listen up! I've discovered something that could blow this whole conspiracy wide open. I found secret symbols hidden in Art's office! We need to investigate further!
:: Liam : sarcastically : Sure, Rachel, maybe he's also in cahoots with the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot.
:: Nia : authoritative : Alright, everyone, let's not get carried away. Rachel, why don't you focus on your actual job and leave the conspiracy theories for your free time?
:: Michael : teasing : Yeah, Rachel, next thing you know, the office printer will be a portal to another dimension.
