>> [6] > 3/3 - Rachel, Carmen, Devika
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, I really think we're onto something big here. We need to act fast before Art's Illuminati agenda takes over the office. We can't let him control us anymore!
:: Carmen : intrigued : I'm not gonna lie, Rachel. I'm still not entirely convinced about this whole conspiracy thing, but it's hard not to get a little caught up in the excitement. So, what's the plan?
:: Devika : mysterious : We've decided to create an impromptu intervention. We'll bring everyone into the conference room, and then we'll confront Art with all our evidence. Surely, he won't be able to deny it then.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Marcus, Rachel, Marko, Devika, Carmen
:: Marcus : chuckling : Rachel, you've really managed to stir things up around here. I must say, I've never seen the office this... enthusiastic. 
:: Rachel : serious : This is no laughing matter, Marcus. We need to expose Art's secret life before it's too late.
:: Marko : jokingly : Yeah, mate, we're in this together now. We've got to stick it to the man and reveal the truth!
:: Devika : smirking : We've got some pretty convincing evidence, you know. It might be enough to force a confession out of Art.
:: Carmen : smiling : Well, if nothing else, this will definitely go down in Oddball Industries history as one of the most bizarre days ever.

>> [16] > 7/7 - Rachel, Marko, Devika, Art, Marcus, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : determined : Art, we've gathered everyone here today because we have something important to discuss. It's time you come clean about your involvement with the Illuminati. We can't be silent any longer.
:: Art : genuinely baffled : The what now? Illumi-who?
:: Marko : assertive : We've got proof, Art. We know all about your secret meetings and coded messages.
:: Devika : smirking : Yeah, we've cracked your codes, and we know the truth.
:: Marcus : bemused : You know, I wonder what happens in a meeting of the Illuminati? Do they play board games or just sit around talking about world domination?
:: Carmen : laughing : Maybe they have a secret handshake and a special dress code, like robes and sunglasses!
:: Liam : rolling his eyes : This is ridiculous. You guys have really gone off the deep end with this one.

== In this act, Rachel and her team of conspiracy theorists attempt to expose Art as a member of the Illuminati by planning an impromptu intervention in the conference room. The intervention becomes a source of amusement for the rest of the office as the absurdity of the situation is highlighted through the jokes and banter. Overall, the mood remains light and playful.
