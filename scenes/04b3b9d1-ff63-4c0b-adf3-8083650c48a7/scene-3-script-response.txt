>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Liam, Sam
:: Nia : casually : So, have you two caught wind of Rachel's bizarre theory about Art being involved in some Illuminati conspiracy?
:: Liam : chuckling : Oh, yeah. It's almost as absurd as the time David tried to convince everyone that he could communicate with squirrels.
:: Sam : smirking : You've got to admit, though, it's a nice break from the mundane office chatter, even if it's completely insane.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Liam, Sam
:: Nia : concerned : I agree that it's entertaining, but we need to make sure this little conspiracy theory doesn't spiral out of control. The last thing we need is for Art to find out and for the entire office to be labeled as nutcases.
:: Liam : grinning : I have an idea. What if we gather some evidence that disproves their wild theories and present it to them? That way, we can put an end to this madness before it gets out of hand.
:: Sam : nodding : That's a solid plan, Liam. Better to nip this in the bud before Art's reputation is in serious jeopardy.

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Liam
:: Nia : determined : Okay, Liam, let's start with Art's work history. We can easily disprove their claims by looking into his past projects and showing that there's no way he could be involved in any secret society.
:: Liam : agreeing : That's perfect, Nia. And I'll dig into his charitable work. I bet there's nothing but good deeds and kindness in his past – hardly the stuff of conspiracies.

>> [9] > 2/3 - Liam, Sam
:: Liam : excited : Sam, I found it! Art has been involved in numerous charitable organizations for decades. There's no way someone with such a clean record could be involved in an evil secret society.
:: Sam : smirking : It's time to burst their little conspiracy bubble. Let's gather everyone in the conference room and present our findings.

== In this act, Nia, Liam, and Sam unite to uncover and debunk the Illuminati conspiracy theory related to Art.
