>> [11] > 3/4 - Rachel, Devika, Carmen
:: Rachel : excited : So Devika, we've got this great opportunity to make the office more fun with this Oddball Odyssey idea, right? Let's create a makeshift "games committee" that involves bringing in unusual items from around the office!
:: Devika : enthusiastic : I love it! It's oddly specific, but I think it could really work. We can use these items to represent repetitive tasks at the company, and the employees can search for them using nothing but their wit and spontaneity.
:: Carmen : brainstorming : That's actually a cool idea! And we can make it a timed challenge too, like, they have to find and bring these items within, let's say... twenty minutes?

>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Marko, Liam
:: David : strategizing : Okay, guys, we need a solid plan for this Oddball Odyssey challenge. Let's carefully think about where we might find these unusual items around the office. Any ideas?
:: Marko : pondering : Well, I've seen some odd things in the storage room. Maybe we could start there?
:: Liam : smirking : You know, I think I might just bend the rules a bit and make this challenge even riskier for myself. After all, what's life without a little excitement?

>> [12] > 1/2 - Marcus
:: Marcus : reflecting : This Oddball Odyssey is going to be interesting... But I have to make sure that everyone plays fair, especially Liam. I don't want him ruining the fun for everyone else with his rule-bending schemes.

:: Carmen : determined : I'm going to find those items faster than anyone else!
