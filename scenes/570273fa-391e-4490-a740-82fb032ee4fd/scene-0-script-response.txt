>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Nia, Marcus, Carmen
:: Art : nostalgic : You know, during lunch, I was playing my all-time favorite video game and it got me thinking. We could really use a shot of energy around here, and what better way than to turn our office into a game-like quest?
:: Marcus : excited : Oh, Art! That sounds like a fantastic idea! Imagine the thrill of searching for hidden energy boosts all around the office. We could even add a reward, like the winner gets to leave an hour early for a week! What do you think, Nia? 
:: Nia : skeptical : Well, it's an interesting idea, but we have to consider if it'll affect productivity. We can't have everyone running around the office all day.
:: Carmen : amused : Oh, come on, Nia! Loosen up a bit. It might just be the change of pace we need to keep things fresh in our daily grind. Plus, who wouldn't want to channel their inner video game hero?

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Marcus : persuasive : Nia, just think about the potential of a video game-inspired adventure right here, in our very own workplace! We could all use a morale boost, and it might even help our team bond more. What do you say?
:: Nia : contemplating : Alright, fine. Let's give it a try. But if it gets out of hand or impacts our work, we're putting a stop to it. Agreed?
:: Art : pleased : Agreed! Let the Oddball Odyssey begin! I never thought I'd see the day when work and play could blend so seamlessly.

== Art suggests a video game-inspired competition to boost employee morale, and Marcus convinces Nia to back the idea. The act focuses on their discussions and the initial excitement around the concept. The banter between characters showcases a mix of skepticism and excitement as they agree to proceed with the idea of the Oddball Odyssey.
