>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, David
:: Liam : smirking : So David, have you heard about Devika's little "experiment"? They say she's got a whole new level of productivity going on! What do you think, mate? Worth giving it a shot?
:: David : nervous : You know, Liam, I've seen her work... It's impressive, but I can't help but question the ethics behind it. I mean, we're a professional company, aren't we? I'm not sure I'm on board with this microdosing thing.

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marcus, Marko, Carmen
:: Marcus : laughing : I mean, can you believe it? Devika's got everyone in a tizzy over her newfound ingenuity, and yet, we all secretly wish we could do the same, am I right?
:: Marko : grinning : Honestly, mate, I wouldn't mind giving it a go. But, I think I'd end up spending half the day just surfing the web for cat videos or something!
:: Carmen : amused : Well, as long as we don't all turn into spaced-out zombies, I guess it couldn't hurt to explore some unconventional methods. It's not like we don't already have our fair share of oddities in this office!

>> [11] > 5/5 - Nia, Rachel, Samantha, Michael, Arthur
:: Nia : serious : Alright, everyone. We need to discuss this situation with Devika. It's causing quite a stir, and we need to come to a consensus on how to handle it.
:: Rachel : excited : You know, I've seen her work, and it's mind-blowing! I mean, maybe we could all use a little creative boost. Just saying...
:: Samantha : stern : We need to remember that there are rules and expectations in the workplace. Encouraging this kind of behavior might set a bad precedent.
:: Michael : chuckling : Come on, Sam, you've got to admit, it's pretty funny watching everyone's reactions to the whole thing.
:: Arthur : pondering : Well, my dear Oddballs, I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. But I do know one thing - if it starts affecting our bottom line, we're going to have a problem.

>> [13] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Liam
:: Nia : determined : Carmen, Liam, as management, we need to make a decision about Devika's experiment. We can't have the entire office following suit if it jeopardizes our professionalism.
:: Carmen : thoughtful : I agree, Nia. But we also have to consider the potential benefits. If it can really boost productivity, maybe it's worth exploring further.
:: Liam : grinning : I say we just let it play out and see where it takes us. If things get out of hand, we'll deal with it then. Until then, let's enjoy the ride.

== In this act, the team becomes divided over their enthusiasm for Devika's practices versus their sense of integrity, despite the impending rewards the productivity boost promises to bring. Conversations between Liam and David, Marcus and Marko, and the group with Arthur reveal divided opinions on whether to embrace or reject Devika's newfound approach. Through managerial discussions between Nia, Carmen, and Liam, they decide to let the situation play out and revisit the issue if necessary.
