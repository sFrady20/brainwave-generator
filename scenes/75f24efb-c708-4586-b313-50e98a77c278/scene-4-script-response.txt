>> [11] > 3/5 - Marcus, Liam, Rachel
:: Marcus : chuckling : You know, Liam, after witnessing Devika's microdosing experiment, I've been considering experimenting with my own odd methods to boost productivity. Maybe I'll start wearing socks with sandals to improve circulation and unleash the true power of my feet!
:: Liam : sarcastically : Oh, Marcus, please don't. The thought of socks with sandals is enough to give me nightmares for weeks.
:: Rachel : interjecting : Well, I heard that standing on one leg while working can increase focus. Who knew flamingos were onto something?

>> [18] > 2/3 - David, Nia
:: David : exaggerating : Nia, I'm literally on the brink of inventing a new type of coffee that will enable us to work 24/7 with no sleep. Can you imagine the possibilities? We'll be unstoppable!
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : David, you know I'm all for improving efficiency, but there's a fine line between inventive and just plain ridiculous. Though, I'll admit, the thought of a supercharged coffee is mildly intriguing.

>> [15] > 3/5 - Carmen, Marko, Devika
:: Carmen : excitedly : You know what, guys? I've decided I'm going to start taking power naps during lunch breaks. I hear the energy boost is fantastic, and hey, it could be a new bonding activity for us in the break room!
:: Marko : laughing : Carmen, you never cease to amaze me with your unique ideas. Just don't start snoring and scare away potential customers on conference calls.
:: Devika : pondering : Hmm, maybe I'll join you, Carmen. I could use some extra energy from my microdosing adventures. Plus, who doesn't love a good nap?

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Samantha
:: Art : reminiscing : You know, Sam, back in the day, we used to have brainstorming sessions on trampolines. We believed that the higher we jumped, the closer we got to the source of inspiration. And boy, did we come up with some crazy ideas!
:: Samantha : incredulously : Art, that's possibly the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. But I have to admit, it would've been a sight to behold.

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Liam
:: Nia : smirking : So, Liam, any plans to adopt Devika's microdosing methods? Or maybe you've got something even wilder up your sleeve?
:: Liam : smugly : Oh, Nia, you know me too well. I've already started researching ways to channel my inner Zen master and achieve peak productivity. However, I'm sworn to secrecy for now.
