>> [2] > 2/2 - Marko, David
:: Marko : excited : Mate, I'm telling you, something supernatural is going on in this office! I've heard from several people that they've experienced some sort of glitch in their computers or that they're remembering events differently!
:: David : amused : Oh, come on, Marko. You really think it's ghosts and not just some weird technical issues? I bet it's just a server issue or something. But I do admire your enthusiasm for the paranormal.

>> [3] > 3/3 - Liam, David, Marcus
:: Liam : skeptical : So, you guys are investigating "ghosts" now? You know, I've always thought there was something a little... supernatural about the way my sales numbers keep going up!
:: David : chuckling : Oh, Liam. Trust you to turn a paranormal investigation into an opportunity to brag about your sales performance. But seriously, we're gathering evidence to see if anything's actually going on here.
:: Marcus : dramatic : Indeed, my friends! We must uncover the hidden truths that lie within the depths of Oddball Industries! We shall not rest until every anomaly is accounted for and every ghostly presence is... unghosted!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Marko, Devika, Carmen
:: Nia : cautiously : Look, guys, I understand that you're passionate about this, but let's not let it interfere with our actual work, okay? If you can gather substantial evidence without affecting productivity, I'm all for it.
:: Marko : determined : No worries, Nia! We'll make sure to keep it all under control while we dive into this spooky mystery.
:: Devika : playfully : And who knows, maybe we'll find some friendly ghost coders to help me with my workload. I could use an extra pair of hands... or, well, you know, ghostly ectoplasm or whatever they have.
:: Carmen : laughing : Yeah, and maybe we can set up a Ghostbusters-style hotline for the office. You know, for any paranormal emergencies! Let's get those ghostly digits, team!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Rachel, Marcus, David
:: Rachel : curious : Hey, guys! I overheard you talking about paranormal stuff. Count me in! I've had a couple of weird things happen with my computer, too. Files disappearing and then reappearing out of nowhere!
:: Marcus : intrigued : Aha! Yet another witness to the supernatural phenomena plaguing our beloved office! We welcome your insights, dear Rachel.
:: David : nodding : Yeah, every bit of information helps us get closer to the truth. Let's just hope we don't end up like that one guy in the horror movie who didn't believe in ghosts and then... well, you know how that goes.
