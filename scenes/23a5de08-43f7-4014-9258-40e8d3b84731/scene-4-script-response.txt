>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Devika, Nia, Marko
:: Art : enthusiastic : Alright, gang! It looks like we stumbled upon something that really brought the team together. I say we capitalize on this energy and make it a yearly event. What do you think of Oddball Spirits Day?
:: Devika : amused : Wow, Art, that's actually a really fun idea! We could design some haunted office equipment and create our own ghost-themed e-cards. It'll be a blast! And who knows, maybe some actual spirits will join in on the fun.
:: Nia : smirking : You know, I was skeptical at first, but I have to admit, this whole ghost hunting thing was pretty entertaining. I think Oddball Spirits Day could be a great team-building exercise and a chance for us all to let loose and have a laugh.
:: Marko : excited : Count me in, mate! I never thought I'd say this, but I had a blast dealing with those imaginary spooks. Can you imagine how fun it would be to create our very own haunted office environment? We could even set up hidden cameras and see how people react to the pranks. What a hoot!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Carmen, Liam
:: Art : energized : Carmen, Liam, I was just telling the others about the idea of Oddball Spirits Day. We could turn our little misadventure into an annual office event, full of pranks and good times.
:: Carmen : grinning : Art, that sounds like a riot! I mean, come on, who wouldn't want to see Liam practically jump out of his skin when he encounters a ghostly printer malfunction?
:: Liam : mock offended : Hey now! It was one time, and I was just caught off guard, alright? But I have to admit, it would be worth the laughs. I'm in.
