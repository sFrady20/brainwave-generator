title: Oddball Paranormal Investigators
exposition: When the Oddball Industries office experiences a bizarre string of glitches in their computer systems, Marko becomes convinced it's the result of paranormal forces at play. Allegedly, the office was built on an old spiritual ground, long forgotten. Swinging the company into action, CEO Art forms an amateur paranormal investigation team composed of Marko, Marcus, and David.

rising action: Despite their differing levels of belief, the team stealthily gathers evidence during work hours, interviewing their coworkers at lunch or by the water cooler about their strange experiences. People are remembering alternate events, files vanish and reappear, and as their evidence accumulates, the team becomes convinced they're indeed dealing with supernatural forces, and even skeptical Nia believes their research is worth pursuing. 

climax: With tensions rising, the team decides to conduct an investigation all night in the office, starting with conducting a séance in the back storage room. They form a technical 'circle of trust', with Marko leading the séance but being- as always- skeptical of the consequences. Temporarily freaked by perceived paranormal sightings, manifesting as shadows of ghost cockroaches trying to digitize Liam’s Sales Archive, the team bands together to confront them but finds out the source of strange occurrences was multiple office pranks done in retaliation by Rachel, who never ratified.

falling action: As the team disperses to eliminate the cause of the glitches, Marko feels down. Nothing exciting happened, really -- they didn't capture ghosts nor help the 'troubled souls' because paranormal elements didn't exist at all. On the other hand, people in the office sprang into teamwork and joked about forming the Oddball Paranormal Research United (a continuously brought-on idea that never quite landed successfully before).

resolution: Wanting to preserve the sense of adventure his team experienced, Art commissions Devika to design an office equipment haunted renovation, summoning occasional office-wide ghost pranks sending celebratory e-cards featuring ghosts from haunted team members. While skeptics abound, for Art and the office Oddballs, the strange occurrences gave employees a moment of wonder and have become long-lasting office folklore turned charming inside joke that they reawaken every year for Halloween, known as Oddball Spirits Day.
