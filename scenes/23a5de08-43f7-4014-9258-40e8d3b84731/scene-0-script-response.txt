>> [11] > 4/4 - Marko, Marcus, David, Nia
:: Marko : excited : Guys, I've been digging into these computer glitches we've been experiencing, and I'm convinced that we're dealing with some paranormal forces here. Hear me out! This office was built on an old spiritual ground, and I think the spirits are trying to communicate with us through technology.
:: Marcus : amused : Marko, my dear friend, while I appreciate your enthusiastic take on the situation, I'm not sure I'm ready to believe in the supernatural just yet. Surely, there must be a more... rational explanation for these glitches, don't you think?
:: David : chuckling : I have to admit, Marko, the idea of ghostly spirits using our computer systems to reach out to us is both hilarious and terrifying. But, seriously, maybe there's just something wrong with our servers, or there's been a recent update that's causing some issues?
:: Nia : intrigued : Well, Marko, as much as I'd love to dive into the spooky world of the supernatural, we are running a business here. But, if you can gather some solid evidence to support your theory, I'm willing to explore this further. Maybe we can form a team to investigate these alleged paranormal occurrences?
:: Marko : determined : Alright, challenge accepted! I'll gather Marcus and David, and together we'll form the Oddball Paranormal Investigation Team. We'll get to the bottom of this and prove that there's more to this world than what meets the eye. Thank you, Nia!
:: Nia : supportive : Just make sure you don't neglect your regular tasks, Marko. But, if you can find a way to prove your theory while keeping up with your work, then go for it. We could all use a little excitement, even if it's in the form of ghostly computer glitches.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Marko, Marcus, David, Art
:: Marko : enthusiastic : Art, I'm glad we could catch you in your office. We wanted to brief you on our plan to investigate the paranormal forces we believe are behind the recent computer glitches in the office. With your blessing, we'd like to form the Oddball Paranormal Investigation Team and gather evidence to support our theory.
:: Art : cheerfully : Well now, that's an interesting proposal! I haven't been this excited about anything since I won that hot dog eating contest back in '84. I'm all for a little office intrigue, as long as it doesn't interfere with your actual work, of course.
:: Marcus : smirking : Sure thing, boss. We'll keep the ghost hunting on the down-low and make sure our regular tasks don't suffer. But if we really do uncover something supernatural, you'll be the first to know.
:: David : laughing : Can you imagine if we actually find ghostly spirits behind the glitches? We'll become the Oddball Industries Paranormal Task Force! But seriously, thanks for your support, Art.
:: Art : warmly : You kids have fun with your little ghost hunt, and remember, if there's something strange in our computer systems, who you gonna call? Oddball Paranormal Investigation Team!

== In this act, Marko, Marcus, and David become convinced that paranormal forces are causing the computer glitches within the office. They pitch the idea to Nia, who is skeptical but allows them to investigate as long as it doesn't impact their regular work. The trio then gets the enthusiastic blessing of CEO Art, and they form the Oddball Paranormal Investigation Team, determined to uncover the truth behind the mysterious glitches.
