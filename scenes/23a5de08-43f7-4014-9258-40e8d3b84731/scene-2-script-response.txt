>> [6] > 3/3 - Marko, David, Marcus
:: Marko : excited : Alright, mates, let's gather around in our 'circle of trust' and commence this séance! I've got my app called 'Ghostly Connections' downloaded and ready to rock. But remember, just because I'm leading this, doesn't mean I'm fully on board with the consequences.
:: David : nervously : Why do I feel like we're about to open a Pandora's box of ghostly cockroaches? I mean, I've seen some weird stuff, but this takes the cake, guys.
:: Marcus : dramatic : Fear not, my fellow Oddballs! Together, we shall traverse the ethereal plane and make contact with the spirits that dwell within these very walls. I wonder if they have Wi-Fi in the afterlife...

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Carmen, Rachel
:: Nia : concerned : I can't believe we're actually letting them do this. I mean, I know things have been strange around here, but a séance? Really?
:: Liam : laughing : I know, right? I half expect them to come running out of the storage room, screaming about ghost cockroaches trying to digitize my sales archive!
:: Carmen : amused : If nothing else, it's good for a laugh. Plus, we all need a little break from the monotony of work, even if it's just chasing phantom bugs.
:: Rachel : smirking : You're right, Carmen. But I can't help feeling a little guilty that I haven't told them about my little pranks yet. They're so focused on the paranormal, it's almost a shame to let them down.

>> [6] > 3/3 - Marko, David, Marcus
:: Marko : chanting : Spirits of the office, we seek your guidance in discovering the source of our recent disturbances. Please show us a sign that you are with us, or at least send us your strongest Wi-Fi signal.
:: David : startled : Guys, guys! I think I just saw a shadow move over by the filing cabinet! Was it a ghost? Or just that darn cockroach we've been trying to catch for weeks?
:: Marcus : determined : Either way, we must confront whatever has been haunting our office! Ghost or not, we're the Oddball Paranormal Investigation Team, and we will protect our coworkers from these strange occurrences!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Carmen, Rachel
:: Nia : surprised : They're really getting into it, aren't they? I never thought I'd see the day when our office would become a paranormal investigators' playground.
:: Liam : smirking : I'm just waiting for them to start talking in tongues or something. That would be the icing on the cake!
:: Carmen : grinning : The séance must be really intense if they're that committed! Maybe they have a future as ghostbusters after all.
:: Rachel : admitting : Alright, you guys, I can't keep it a secret any longer. The strange occurrences they're investigating? They're just a series of pranks I've been pulling. I never expected them to take it this far, but it's kind of hilarious, isn't it?

== In this act, the Oddball Paranormal Investigation Team conducts a séance in the back storage room, led by a hesitant Marko. Amidst the chanting and ghostly banter, David becomes convinced he saw a shadowy figure, causing the team to rally together and confront the unknown. Back in the lunch kitchen, Nia, Liam, Carmen, and Rachel discuss the absurdity of the situation and enjoy the humorous aspect of their coworkers' earnest paranormal investigation. The act concludes with Rachel admitting to being the mastermind behind the pranks that led to the strange occurrences, and the coworkers in the lunch kitchen have a good laugh about the entire situation.
