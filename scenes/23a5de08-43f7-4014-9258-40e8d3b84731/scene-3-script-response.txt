>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Liam, Carmen
:: Nia : chuckling : Can you believe this wacky paranormal investigation team idea? It had us all running around the office like headless chickens! 
:: Liam : amused : I know, right? But hey, it did bring some fun into our mundane work life. Everyone needs a little break from the norm, even if it's all based on some silly ghost story.
:: Carmen : smirking : You know, I was secretly hoping they'd find some ghosts, even if it were just for the thrill of it. But the fact that it was just Rachel playing pranks on us all is absolutely hilarious.

>> [2] > 1/2 - David, Marcus
:: David : disappointed : Man, I really thought we were onto something with this paranormal investigation, you know? I was imagining myself as a ghostbuster, saving the office from supernatural threats.
:: Marcus : consoling : Don't worry, David. Even though we didn't find any real ghosts, we did manage to bring the office together with some much-needed laughter. Plus, we can always claim we made contact with the other side, and nobody can prove we didn't!

>> [15] > 4/5 - Marko, Devika, Art, Rachel
:: Marko : sighing : I guess I was just hoping for something more... exciting. A grand adventure, you know? But it turns out we were all just chasing shadows.
:: Devika : cheerfully : Hey, don't be too hard on yourself, Marko. At least it gave us all a reason to unite and collaborate, even if it was for a completely ridiculous cause.
:: Art : grinning : You know what, guys? I think we should make this an annual event—a sort of Oddball Paranormal Research Day! It's like a team-building exercise and a comedy show rolled into one.
:: Rachel : giggling : I never expected my pranks to escalate like this, but I'm glad everyone had a good time. And who knows, maybe next time we'll actually find some ghosts!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Art : excited : I already have some ideas for next year's Oddball Paranormal Research Day. For starters, we could have a contest for the best ghost costume, and we could even create a scavenger hunt with clues hidden throughout the office!
:: Nia : smiling : Art, that actually sounds like a fantastic team-building idea. We can incorporate some of our company values and objectives into it, making it both fun and productive.
:: Liam : eager : Count me in! I could even share some of my "authentic" ghost stories from my travels. And by authentic, I mean completely made up, but highly entertaining!

== In this act, the office disperses to eliminate the cause of the glitches, with Marko feeling down about the lack of true paranormal activity. However, the team finds consolation in the fact that their wild ghost chase brought the office together for a good laugh. Art proposes an annual event, the Oddball Paranormal Research Day, as both a team-building exercise and a comedy show. Everyone is on board with the idea, and they start brainstorming ways to make it even more fun and engaging for next year.
