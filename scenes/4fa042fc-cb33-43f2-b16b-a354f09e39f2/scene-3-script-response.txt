>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Nia : excited : Alright, team! Let's get to work on this organic lunchbox innards chair for Art. It's going to be the weirdest masterpiece of a chair anyone has ever seen!
:: David : chuckling : Agreed, Nia. Just imagine Art's face when we present him the Oddball Throne - truly a sight to behold!
:: Carmen : grinning : I've got a great stash of eco-friendly materials and a glue gun ready to assemble this beauty. Let's make history, Oddball style!
:: Liam : smirking : You know, I once met a guy who built a whole house out of lunchbox innards... or was it peanut shells? Ah well, either way, how hard could it be to make a chair?

>> [13] > 3/3 - Carmen, Rachel, Devika
:: Carmen : concentrating : Alright, Rachel, could you hand me that roll of kale tape? We need to make sure this chair is sturdy and fashionable.
:: Rachel : amused : Sure, Carmen! Who would have thought that kale tape would become such an essential part of our lives? Here you go.
:: Devika : thoughtfully : I've seen some eco-friendly designs in my time, but this one definitely takes the cake... or should I say, the organic, gluten-free, dairy-free cake?

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Marcus, Michael
:: Marko : proud : I've managed to create a blueprint for the chair, incorporating all our eco-materials. Now all we need to do is stick to the plan and assemble it.
:: Marcus : nervous : Well, as the accidental cause of this chair catastrophe, I promise to do my best to help fix this mess...I hope Art likes it in the end.
:: Michael : reassuring : Don't worry, Marcus. We've got your back, and this chair is shaping up to be something truly unique, much like Art himself!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Nia, David, Carmen, Liam, Rachel
:: Nia : impressed : Wow, you guys, we've done it! This chair is... dare I say it... a monstrosity of creativity and resourcefulness!
:: David : laughing : I bet this chair could survive the apocalypse with all its craziness. Art will definitely appreciate the effort!
:: Carmen : satisfied : There is no greater testament to our team spirit than this chair... this, uh, beautiful chair.
:: Liam : smirking : Let's make sure to take a photo, because no one will believe this is real unless they see it with their own eyes!
:: Rachel : excited : I can't wait to see Art's reaction to this glorious tribute to his beloved office chair.
