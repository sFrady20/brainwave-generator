>> [19] > 2/3 - Arthur, Liam
:: Arthur : stern : Alright, Liam, it's your turn to explain yourself. My beloved chair didn't just fall apart on its own, and I need to know the full story. Where were you last night and why should I believe you? 
:: Liam : confidently : Art, my man, I have alibis crossing four different dimensions! I was both here and not here, in the future and in the past. I'm practically a time-traveling wizard, and you know you can't pin any chair-related mischief on a wizard!
>> [11] > 2/4 - Nia, Devika
:: Nia : casual : So, Devika, this chair situation is getting out of hand. I hear you have some crazy ideas about fixing the situation. Care to share?
:: Devika : excitedly : Oh, Nia! I have the perfect solution! We're going to use the rarest of materials: unicorn tears! We'll painstakingly craft a chair so majestic, so perfect, that it will outshine even Art's old chair!
:: Nia : sarcastically : Oh, fantastic! I'm sure we have a whole stockpile of unicorn tears lying around. I'll just send someone to Mars to pick up a jar, and we'll be good to go.
:: Devika : grinning : You'd be surprised, Nia! My ideas may seem far-fetched, but they always have a touch of magic. Just wait and see.

>> [8] > 2/3 - Marko, Rachel
:: Marko : animated : Crikey, Rachel! This chair debacle has everyone in a tizzy. You hear anything juicy from that receptionist desk of yours?
:: Rachel : gossiping : You wouldn't believe the things I've heard, Marko! Some claim it was a ghost, others say it's an inside job. People are even starting to make bets on who the culprit is. Honestly, I'm loving all the excitement!
:: Marko : chuckling : Well, if you ever want to place a cheeky bet on the office chair destroyer, just let me know. I've got a few theories of my own.
:: Rachel : smirking : Oh, I'll keep that in mind, Marko. All this talk of betting and theories makes for one wild day at Oddball Industries.

>> [6] > 2/3 - Carmen, Samantha
:: Carmen : curious : Sam, do you know anything about this chair mystery? You're usually on top of things around here.
:: Samantha : serious : I take my job as head of security very seriously, Carmen. But even I'm stumped on this one. The chair was perfectly fine when I did my rounds, then poof! It's destroyed overnight. It's baffling.
:: Carmen : playfully : Well, if the chair mysteriously vanished like a phantom, I guess we're all in for a spooky ride! Better watch out for things that go bump in the night, Sam!
