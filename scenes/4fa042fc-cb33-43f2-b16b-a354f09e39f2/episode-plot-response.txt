title: The Oddfather
exposition: Art Beecham wakes up one morning to discover that his beloved office chair has been demolished in the night. Suspecting foul play, he privately calls each of the Oddball employees onto the carpet, demanding loyalty like a pop culture-worthy mafia boss.

rising action: As each office member is interrogated, the individual character's odd habits and secrets come to light. Liam O'Connell, the spirited Director of Sales, claims to have alibis crossed "in four different dimensions," all fabricated of course. Devika Sharma, the out-of-the-box free-spirit, comes up with impossible office chair resurrections such as forming it from unicorn tears, horrifyingly convincing giggles.

climax: Samantha discovers security footage implicating Marcus in the chair catastrophe, but it turns out to have been a nearsighted attempt at art installation based on their version of Monartaville. In typical Marcus fashion, he accidentally demolished the chair but left a metal yarn ball inspired sculpture in its place.

falling action: The rest of the team bands together to help secretly piece together a replacement chair for Art even as they worry about Office Warfare of the Sentimental Kind. Our widely talented cast throws wisdom and absurdity atop each other on this off-kilter quest for Art's acceptance, culminating in memorable exchanges based on their peculiar vices and team spirit.

resolution: In an unexpected turn of events, Art is ready to accept Marcus saying everything was an accident but restores the chair made of organic lunchbox innards anyway, showing his odd devotion to his "family" in return. As everything settles down, the crew ends up half considering renaming their software design firm to include something about art demolition in order not to waste their fresh unintentional expertise area.
