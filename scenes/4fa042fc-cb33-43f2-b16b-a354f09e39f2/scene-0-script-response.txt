>> [19] > 1/3 - Art, Rachel
:: Art : frustrated : Rachel, I cannot believe this! My favorite office chair, my trusty companion for the past 20 years, was demolished overnight! Someone must pay!
:: Rachel : surprised : Oh no, Art! That's terrible news! But are you sure it was done on purpose? It could've been an accident.
:: Art : determined : That's not the point, Rachel! My chair and I have been through thick and thin together, and I demand loyalty from my Oddball family. I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Art, Liam
:: Nia : confused : Art, do you really think one of us is responsible for what happened to your chair? Maybe it just broke on its own.
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, Art. I mean, I have alibis crossed in four different dimensions, all highly embellished of course, but I'm sure I'm not the culprit.
:: Art : stern : I'm not taking any chances, Nia. We're going to figure out who did this, even if it takes all day. I want you all to help me find the culprit, and whoever did it will face the wrath of Art Beecham, the Oddfather!
:: Nia : sighing : Well, if you insist. But remember, we have work to do too, Art. We can't just drop everything to find the chair culprit.

>> [9] > 3/3 - Art, Marcus, David
:: Art : questioning : Marcus, you're an art enthusiast. Have you heard of any new art installations that involve demolishing office chairs? It's a long shot, I know. And David, did you accidentally stumble into my office and break the chair with your clumsy ways?
:: Marcus : amused : Art, I appreciate the creative spin you're giving this situation, but I haven't heard of any art installations that involve chair destruction. However, if that were the case, it would be a very avant-garde statement indeed.
:: David : defensive : Hey, I may be clumsy, but I certainly would have remembered breaking your chair, Art! My love for puns could never overshadow my professional responsibility. You know, like not committing a "chair-icide."

>> [7] > 2/2 - Art, Devika
:: Art : suspicious : Devika, I need your outside-the-box thinking here. How would you bring a demolished chair back to life? Any crazy idea is worth considering.
:: Devika : pondering : Well, Art, I could try to conjure up some unicorn tears to resurrect the chair, but I'm afraid we'd need an actual unicorn for that. And my giggles aren't that powerful yet! But maybe we could create a new chair out of recycled materials? It wouldn't be the same, but it would still be something special.

== Art suspects that someone in the office is responsible for the destruction of his beloved office chair. He interrogates each employee, trying to gauge their loyalty and involvement in the case, while the employees engage in banter and absurdity. As Art is hyper-focused on solving the case, some employees question his prioritization, while others play along with his obsession. The act ends with no definitive answer to who demolished the chair, leaving the mystery unsolved for now.
