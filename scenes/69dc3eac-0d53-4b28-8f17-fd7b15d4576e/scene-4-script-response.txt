>> [18] > 3/3 - Mike, Art, Marcus
:: Mike : laughing hard : Guys, you won't believe it! I just dropped my car keys down that secret tunnel, and guess what? There's a hidden treasure trove down there!

:: Art : surprised : Wait, what?! Are you serious? That's absolutely insane!

:: Marcus : genuinely funny : Ah, the fickle hand of fate! What are the odds it would bring us an escape from boredom and riches at the same time?

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : hurriedly : Nia, we need to switch gears. We can't let anyone find out about this treasure. We should establish a work retreat and call it "The Oddball family appreciation retreat." What do you think?

:: Nia : sarcastic : Oh sure, just a casual escape from our boring workday to dig up hidden treasure... Sounds completely normal and not at all suspicious!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Liam, Carmen, David
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, have you heard? There's a treasure trove hidden beneath our secret tunnel!

:: Liam : sarcastic : What's next, we find out our office sits on a portal to another dimension?

:: Carmen : laughing : At this point, I wouldn't even be surprised!

:: David : jokingly : Well, at least we could escape the boredom of the office a little more... dramatically.

>> [20] > 6/6 - Art, Marcus, Mike, Devika, Marko, Sam
:: Art : ordering : Alright, team! We're going to organize a company retreat to... "appreciate" our Oddball family. *wink* Let's get everyone on board and make this a ridiculously over-the-top event to keep our treasure a secret!

:: Marcus : excited : I'm on it, Art! Nothing like team building exercises to keep our treasure under wraps!

:: Mike : grinning : Time to break out the trust falls and group hugs! We've got a retreat to plan!

:: Devika : sarcastically : Oh great, just what we need. As if things weren't weird enough around here.

:: Marko : cheeky : Well, at least we'll be rich in team spirit... and maybe in gold coins too!

:: Sam : deadpan : Yeah, because nothing screams "normal office activity" like digging for buried treasure together.
