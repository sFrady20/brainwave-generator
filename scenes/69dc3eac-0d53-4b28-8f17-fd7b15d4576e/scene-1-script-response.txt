>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Liam, Marcus, Carmen
:: Rachel : excited : Alright, guys, we need to find the perfect hiding spots for these digging tools. Suggest some ideas, and remember: the more absurd, the better!
:: Liam : sarcastically : How about we stash them in Art's office? No one ever goes in there. 
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh, Liam, that would be such a delight, but we don't want to cut it too close, do we? 
:: Carmen : smirking : What about the filing cabinets in the storage room? We can label it under "top-secret tunneling project."

>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Devika, Marko
:: David : calculating : So if we start digging from the storage room, we'll need to head south and then take a sharp turn westward to avoid the plumbing. Any objections?
:: Devika : thoughtful : I think that should work as long as we maintain a consistent angle on the turns. We wouldn't want to accidentally resurface in the middle of a meeting.
:: Marko : grinning : Just imagine Art's face if we suddenly popped up during his next motivational speech!

>> [6] > 3/3 - Marcus, Sam, Nia
:: Marcus : conspiratorially : Alright, Sam. I need your help in setting up a watch rotation so we don't get caught digging. Promise me you won't tell a soul about our little project?
:: Sam : suspicious : I'll help you, Marcus. But really, a tunnel? That seems a bit extreme.
:: Nia : overhearing : What's this about a tunnel? Marcus, what are you getting yourself into?
:: Marcus : nervously : Oh, nothing, Nia. Just a little office project to keep things interesting. Everything is under control!

>> [9] > 3/3 - Art, Liam, David
:: Art : panicking : Gentlemen, we need to have a serious talk. I've heard whispers of this tunnel idea, and I'm concerned for our employees' wellbeing.
:: Liam : smirking : Art, relax! It's just a bit of fun, some light-hearted office mischief.
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, Art. Besides, the tunnel will never actually reach completion. It's just a great way to bond as a team and bring some excitement to our daily grind.

== In this act, the Oddball employees pursue their absurd tunnel idea. Rachel gathers and hides digging tools while David plots the tunnel's route. Marcus attempts to set up a watch rotation with Sam's help but accidentally reveals her fear of cats, causing chaos among the employees engaging in casual cat-related conversations. Meanwhile, Art and Nia begin to worry about the implications of the tunnel idea but are reassured by Liam and David that it's just an innocent bonding exercise.
