title: The Great Corporate Escape
exposition: Art accidentally plays "The Shawshank Redemption" in the office projector during a mandatory meeting, leading the employees to come up with the absurd idea of digging a tunnel out of the office building to escape the boredom of their 9-5 routine. Each character randomly decides on a task necessary to execute this utterly insane plan.

rising action: As each character embarks on this nonsensical journey, their normal work life starts to become more and more tricky. Rachel takes charge of sourcing and hiding digging tools in absurd locations like the filing cabinets and trash bins. While David calculates the route their tunnel should take, Marcus' attempt to organize a complicated watch rotation around Sam uncovers her unusual fear of cats, causing hilarious panic disruptions near employees having innocent cat chats.

climax: The Oddball employees have been digging the tunnel for weeks under everyone's noses, team spirit is at an all-time high due to a rotating video made in front of the green screen showcasing Art's secret dance moves. However, during the secret 'movie night' organized in David's cubicle dedicated to discussing their successful first 'dig-venture' scene, Nia accidentally finds the makeshift tunnel in the storage room as she goes looking for printer paper.

falling action: Word spreads quickly of Nia's awakening, surprises and plot absurdity start to unroll as they are confronted individually in unique ways like slowly breaking the ice on the mens bathroom sink with water cooler chats, thorough security screenings in the security office, and the over-educated debate on motivation surrounding random trust exercises in small conference room meetings.

resolution: Just as everyone accepts they will be called to the executive office, one character at a time starting with Art, for a proper confrontation, Mike drops Michael's car keys while laughing on hold presenting an uproar exclaiming that his prank accidentally dug a lush escape buried treasure down what the Oddballs schemed as the secret tunnel. Art goes scurrying establishing the tasks, descriptions and teamwork effort still attempting to hide the entirety of the tunnel to work from here on out; calling it their little team building exercise that he requested "The Oddball family appreciation retreat".
