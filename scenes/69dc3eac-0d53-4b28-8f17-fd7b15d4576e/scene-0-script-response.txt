>> [16] > 5/7 - Art, Rachel, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Art : perplexed : Well folks, I did not mean to screen "The Shawshank Redemption" today, but here we are. Let's make the most of it, shall we?
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Yeah, perfect inspiration for a Monday morning, right? So, which one of us is crawling through a mile of sewage to escape our boring 9-5 job?
:: David : laughing : Well, if we're getting specific, it's actually 500 yards, but who's counting? I'm personally enjoying my job without the need for any tunnel digging.
:: Carmen : excited : Oh, come on, David! Where's your sense of adventure? Can you imagine the thrill of secretly digging a tunnel right under the boss's nose? I'm in!
:: Marcus : chuckling : I must admit, the idea is oddly appealing. Can you picture Art's face when he discovers he's been outsmarted? Priceless!

>> [11] > 3/4 - Devika, Liam, Nia
:: Devika : conspiratorially : So I heard the others are actually considering this bizarre tunnel idea. What do you think about it?
:: Liam : smirking : I have to say, it's tempting. Imagine the excitement of working on such a ludicrous project together! Let's embrace the madness.
:: Nia : reluctantly : As much as I'd love to indulge in this harebrained scheme, I have to remind everyone that our main priority should be our actual jobs. That being said, a little fun never hurt anybody, right?

>> [22] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : defensively : Look, Nia, I didn't mean for this to happen. But since it did, maybe it's a sign that our employees need a little excitement in their lives.
:: Nia : concerned : I understand, Art, but we can't let this tunnel idea spiral out of control. We need to find a way to direct their enthusiasm towards something more productive.

>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Marcus, Carmen
:: David : contemplating : So, if we're actually doing this, we'll need a detailed map of the building and some calculations to figure out the optimal tunnel route.
:: Marcus : grinning : Ah, David, always the voice of reason. I'll work on obtaining the blueprints. And I think I have a way to distract our security guards...
:: Carmen : excited : This is going to be legendary! And don't worry, guys, I have a plan to keep the digging tools hidden in plain sight. They'll never know what hit them!

Each character has a specific task to contribute towards the seemingly ridiculous plan. While Art and Nia worry about the tunnel idea's implications, the others fully embrace it, finding ways to start executing the plan without arousing suspicion.
