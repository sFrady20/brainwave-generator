>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Liam
:: Marcus : chuckling : Liam, have you seen that video of Art's secret dance moves yet? I can't believe we managed to get it on camera during our green screen session!
:: Liam : smirking : I have, Marcus. It's pure gold! Who would've thought the big boss man had some moves up his sleeves? And it's done wonders for the team spirit, hasn't it?

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, David
:: Devika : excited : David, I heard about the secret movie night happening in your cubicle tonight. We're watching the first 'dig-venture' scene, right? This is going to be legendary!
:: David : grinning : Yep, that's the plan, Devika! I've managed to set up a makeshift projector in my cubicle. Just make sure to be subtle about it, we don't want Nia catching wind of our little gathering.

>> [20] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, Carmen
:: Nia : suspicious : Rachel, Carmen, have you noticed anything odd going on around here? I feel like there's something happening that I'm not aware of.
:: Rachel : nervously : N-no, Nia! Everything is just normal, you know, the usual office stuff. Right, Carmen?
:: Carmen : chuckling : Oh, Nia, it's just another day at Oddball Industries. Just take it easy and enjoy the ride!

>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Devika, Marcus
:: David : hurriedly : Marcus, Devika, the movie night is about to start! Everyone's gathered at my cubicle. We need to make sure Nia doesn't find out!
:: Devika : giggling : Let's do this! This is the most exciting thing we've done in ages!
:: Marcus : grinning : Don't worry, I've got our backs. Nia is busy in her office. Let's sneak away like master spies!

>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Rachel, Liam
:: Nia : searching : I need some printer paper, where's the storage room? I swear, this place is like a maze sometimes.
:: Rachel : hesitating : Uh, it's just down the hall, Nia. But, um, maybe I can grab it for you?
:: Liam : chiming in : Yeah, Nia, I can help too. No need for you to go all the way there!
:: Nia : dismissive : No, it's fine. I need a break anyway. I'll be back in a jiffy.

>> [6] > 3/3 - Nia, David, Marcus
:: Nia : shocked : What the...? Is this a tunnel? What's going on here? David, Marcus, what is this madness?
:: David : stuttering : N-Nia, it's, uh, not what it looks like! I swear! It's just a little... team building exercise.
:: Marcus : nervously : Y-yeah! We just wanted to, you know, bring everyone together with a little harmless fun...
>> [11] > 1/4 - Rachel
:: Rachel : worriedly : Oh no, Nia's going to find the tunnel. This is going to be a disaster!

== Nia discovers the tunnel in the storage room, and confronts David and Marcus about it. They try to pass it off as a harmless team building exercise. Rachel worries about the consequences of Nia's discovery. The team watches their first 'dig-venture' scene during a secret movie night in David's cubicle, as tension builds around Nia's newfound knowledge of the tunnel.
