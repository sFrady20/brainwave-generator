>> [16] > 5/7 - Art, Rachel, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Art : perplexed : Well folks, I did not mean to screen "The Shawshank Redemption" today, but here we are. Let's make the most of it, shall we?
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Yeah, perfect inspiration for a Monday morning, right? So, which one of us is crawling through a mile of sewage to escape our boring 9-5 job?
:: David : laughing : Well, if we're getting specific, it's actually 500 yards, but who's counting? I'm personally enjoying my job without the need for any tunnel digging.
:: Carmen : excited : Oh, come on, David! Where's your sense of adventure? Can you imagine the thrill of secretly digging a tunnel right under the boss's nose? I'm in!
:: Marcus : chuckling : I must admit, the idea is oddly appealing. Can you picture Art's face when he discovers he's been outsmarted? Priceless!
>> [11] > 3/4 - Devika, Liam, Nia
:: Devika : conspiratorially : So I heard the others are actually considering this bizarre tunnel idea. What do you think about it?
:: Liam : smirking : I have to say, it's tempting. Imagine the excitement of working on such a ludicrous project together! Let's embrace the madness.
:: Nia : reluctantly : As much as I'd love to indulge in this harebrained scheme, I have to remind everyone that our main priority should be our actual jobs. That being said, a little fun never hurt anybody, right?
>> [22] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : defensively : Look, Nia, I didn't mean for this to happen. But since it did, maybe it's a sign that our employees need a little excitement in their lives.
:: Nia : concerned : I understand, Art, but we can't let this tunnel idea spiral out of control. We need to find a way to direct their enthusiasm towards something more productive.
>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Marcus, Carmen
:: David : contemplating : So, if we're actually doing this, we'll need a detailed map of the building and some calculations to figure out the optimal tunnel route.
:: Marcus : grinning : Ah, David, always the voice of reason. I'll work on obtaining the blueprints. And I think I have a way to distract our security guards...
:: Carmen : excited : This is going to be legendary! And don't worry, guys, I have a plan to keep the digging tools hidden in plain sight. They'll never know what hit them!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Liam, Marcus, Carmen
:: Rachel : excited : Alright, guys, we need to find the perfect hiding spots for these digging tools. Suggest some ideas, and remember: the more absurd, the better!
:: Liam : sarcastically : How about we stash them in Art's office? No one ever goes in there. 
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh, Liam, that would be such a delight, but we don't want to cut it too close, do we? 
:: Carmen : smirking : What about the filing cabinets in the storage room? We can label it under "top-secret tunneling project."
>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Devika, Marko
:: David : calculating : So if we start digging from the storage room, we'll need to head south and then take a sharp turn westward to avoid the plumbing. Any objections?
:: Devika : thoughtful : I think that should work as long as we maintain a consistent angle on the turns. We wouldn't want to accidentally resurface in the middle of a meeting.
:: Marko : grinning : Just imagine Art's face if we suddenly popped up during his next motivational speech!
>> [6] > 3/3 - Marcus, Sam, Nia
:: Marcus : conspiratorially : Alright, Sam. I need your help in setting up a watch rotation so we don't get caught digging. Promise me you won't tell a soul about our little project?
:: Sam : suspicious : I'll help you, Marcus. But really, a tunnel? That seems a bit extreme.
:: Nia : overhearing : What's this about a tunnel? Marcus, what are you getting yourself into?
:: Marcus : nervously : Oh, nothing, Nia. Just a little office project to keep things interesting. Everything is under control!
>> [9] > 3/3 - Art, Liam, David
:: Art : panicking : Gentlemen, we need to have a serious talk. I've heard whispers of this tunnel idea, and I'm concerned for our employees' wellbeing.
:: Liam : smirking : Art, relax! It's just a bit of fun, some light-hearted office mischief.
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, Art. Besides, the tunnel will never actually reach completion. It's just a great way to bond as a team and bring some excitement to our daily grind.
>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Liam
:: Marcus : chuckling : Liam, have you seen that video of Art's secret dance moves yet? I can't believe we managed to get it on camera during our green screen session!
:: Liam : smirking : I have, Marcus. It's pure gold! Who would've thought the big boss man had some moves up his sleeves? And it's done wonders for the team spirit, hasn't it?
>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, David
:: Devika : excited : David, I heard about the secret movie night happening in your cubicle tonight. We're watching the first 'dig-venture' scene, right? This is going to be legendary!
:: David : grinning : Yep, that's the plan, Devika! I've managed to set up a makeshift projector in my cubicle. Just make sure to be subtle about it, we don't want Nia catching wind of our little gathering.
>> [20] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, Carmen
:: Nia : suspicious : Rachel, Carmen, have you noticed anything odd going on around here? I feel like there's something happening that I'm not aware of.
:: Rachel : nervously : N-no, Nia! Everything is just normal, you know, the usual office stuff. Right, Carmen?
:: Carmen : chuckling : Oh, Nia, it's just another day at Oddball Industries. Just take it easy and enjoy the ride!
>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Devika, Marcus
:: David : hurriedly : Marcus, Devika, the movie night is about to start! Everyone's gathered at my cubicle. We need to make sure Nia doesn't find out!
:: Devika : giggling : Let's do this! This is the most exciting thing we've done in ages!
:: Marcus : grinning : Don't worry, I've got our backs. Nia is busy in her office. Let's sneak away like master spies!
>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Rachel, Liam
:: Nia : searching : I need some printer paper, where's the storage room? I swear, this place is like a maze sometimes.
:: Rachel : hesitating : Uh, it's just down the hall, Nia. But, um, maybe I can grab it for you?
:: Liam : chiming in : Yeah, Nia, I can help too. No need for you to go all the way there!
:: Nia : dismissive : No, it's fine. I need a break anyway. I'll be back in a jiffy.
>> [6] > 3/3 - Nia, David, Marcus
:: Nia : shocked : What the...? Is this a tunnel? What's going on here? David, Marcus, what is this madness?
:: David : stuttering : N-Nia, it's, uh, not what it looks like! I swear! It's just a little... team building exercise.
:: Marcus : nervously : Y-yeah! We just wanted to, you know, bring everyone together with a little harmless fun...
>> [11] > 1/4 - Rachel
:: Rachel : worriedly : Oh no, Nia's going to find the tunnel. This is going to be a disaster!
>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, David
:: Nia : sternly : David, I can't believe you guys were digging a tunnel in the storage room. What were you all thinking?
:: David : nervously : Well, you know... we thought it was a fun way to bond as a team, like a quirky team-building exercise!
>> [9] > 3/3 - Liam, Marcus, Marko
:: Liam : mockingly : So, Nia finally found out about the tunnel, huh? What a mess we've gotten ourselves into!
:: Marcus : defensively : It was all in the name of fun and camaraderie, Liam. No need to be so negative about it.
:: Marko : jokingly : Yeah, who wouldn't want to escape this 9-5 lifestyle, even if only in the most absurd way?
>> [4] > 3/3 - Carmen, Rachel, Devika
:: Carmen : amused : You know, I never thought I'd be part of an underground tunnel operation. Life's full of surprises!
:: Rachel : worried : I'm just concerned about the consequences of Nia's discovery. Things could get really ugly.
:: Devika : carefree : Hey, we had fun while it lasted, right? And I think it actually brought us all closer together.
>> [17] > 2/2 - Art, Mike
:: Art : nervously : Mike, I hope this whole tunnel situation doesn't get out of hand. We need to find a way to manage the fallout.
:: Mike : chuckling : Oh, Art, don't worry! It was all just a bit of fun. Besides, it's not every day someone tries to dig their way out of the office!
>> [1] > 4/4 - Nia, Rachel, Marcus, David
:: Nia : assertively : Look, everyone, I understand you were trying to have fun, but we have a company to run. No more tunnel digging, okay?
:: Rachel : apologetically : Sorry, Nia. It was never our intention to cause any trouble. I promise we'll get back to work now.
:: Marcus : cheekily : But hey, at least we have a hilarious story to tell at the next company party, right?
:: David : sheepishly : Yeah, I guess you're right, Marcus. Though, I think it's safe to say we've learned our lesson.
>> [18] > 3/3 - Mike, Art, Marcus
:: Mike : laughing hard : Guys, you won't believe it! I just dropped my car keys down that secret tunnel, and guess what? There's a hidden treasure trove down there!
:: Art : surprised : Wait, what?! Are you serious? That's absolutely insane!
:: Marcus : genuinely funny : Ah, the fickle hand of fate! What are the odds it would bring us an escape from boredom and riches at the same time?
>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : hurriedly : Nia, we need to switch gears. We can't let anyone find out about this treasure. We should establish a work retreat and call it "The Oddball family appreciation retreat." What do you think?
:: Nia : sarcastic : Oh sure, just a casual escape from our boring workday to dig up hidden treasure... Sounds completely normal and not at all suspicious!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Liam, Carmen, David
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, have you heard? There's a treasure trove hidden beneath our secret tunnel!
:: Liam : sarcastic : What's next, we find out our office sits on a portal to another dimension?
:: Carmen : laughing : At this point, I wouldn't even be surprised!
:: David : jokingly : Well, at least we could escape the boredom of the office a little more... dramatically.
>> [20] > 6/6 - Art, Marcus, Mike, Devika, Marko, Sam
:: Art : ordering : Alright, team! We're going to organize a company retreat to... "appreciate" our Oddball family. *wink* Let's get everyone on board and make this a ridiculously over-the-top event to keep our treasure a secret!
:: Marcus : excited : I'm on it, Art! Nothing like team building exercises to keep our treasure under wraps!
:: Mike : grinning : Time to break out the trust falls and group hugs! We've got a retreat to plan!
:: Devika : sarcastically : Oh great, just what we need. As if things weren't weird enough around here.
:: Marko : cheeky : Well, at least we'll be rich in team spirit... and maybe in gold coins too!
:: Sam : deadpan : Yeah, because nothing screams "normal office activity" like digging for buried treasure together.
