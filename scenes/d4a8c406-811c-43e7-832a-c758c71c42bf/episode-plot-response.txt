title: Art's Mystical Keyboard
exposition: A strange, ancient keyboard appears in Art's office, which he assumes that someone left behind. As he begins to type, he quickly begins to realize that any nonsensical sentence he types on this mystical keyboard instantly becomes reality. Unfortunately, this kicks off a series of unexpected and catastrophic events around the office.

rising action: As news of the keyboard's abilities spreads throughout the office, each character becomes desperate to get their hands on it for their own personal gain. In their bids for control of the keyboard, characters act increasingly paranoid and conniving, approaching comedic levels of hysteria, amplified by Art's silliness.

climax: At the peak of the madness, the pandemonium careens out of control. The office is ravaged by the bizarre and idiosyncratic desires of the Oddball characters. Talking cats compete with artisanal, cheese-stealing hedgehogs while an indoor blizzard rages between bathroom stalls. There's no time for the staff to actually get work done, and things look financially dire for their professional futures.

falling action: Nia devises a method to organize the fight for the keyboard, so the wealth of mysticism is more fairly shared around the office. A management system brings semi-calm to Oddball Industries, but the string of ludicrous and funny debacles stemming from mystical wish-based desires continue, even culminating in property damage.

resolution: Art, alarmed by the fact that his once-thriving company is now consumed by insane capriciousness and with barely a productive employee left, he falsely blames the product failures and resulting fiscal losses on his personal incompetence of his carefree mystic-typing requests. The team realizes the opportunity cost of their fantasies, diligently drops their various odd changes, and opts to return the keyboard to Art so he might dispose of this irresistible device that triggered their fantastical urges. Art himself finds peace in the humble return to normalcy and reunites his staff by pitching a lighthearted farewell party cleaning up workplace mayhem side by side.
