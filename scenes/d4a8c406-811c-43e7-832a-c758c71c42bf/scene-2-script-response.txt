>> [11] > 3/4 - Liam, David, Marcus
:: Liam : excited : You wouldn't believe what I just typed on Art's mystical keyboard, fellas! I've always dreamed of having talking cats around the office, and now they're here! I can't wait to discuss the most intricate details of the art of napping with them.
:: David : overwhelmed : That's wild, Liam! But don't you think we've gone a little overboard with this? There's a cheese-stealing hedgehog in the break room, Marcus! A hedgehog!
:: Marcus : chuckling : You've got to admit, it's pretty impressive that the little fella knows his artisanal cheeses. Besides, who needs a cheese platter when we've got an indoor blizzard that's giving the term "chilling out" a whole new meaning?

>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Rachel
:: Nia : concerned : Ladies, the office is descending into chaos! We need to somehow regain control over this situation. Can any of you think of a way to manage this madness?
:: Carmen : joking : Maybe we could open a petting zoo, but instead of charging admission, people could pay us in productivity?
:: Rachel : sarcastic : Oh, yeah, I can see it now: "Welcome to Oddball Industries, home of the talking cats and the cheese-loving hedgehogs! Just be careful not to slip on the ice!"

>> [18] > 2/3 - Devika, Marko
:: Devika : panicking : Guys, the entire office is turning into a lunatic asylum! I can't focus on my work anymore, and with all these bizarre things happening, we won't make any progress!
:: Marko : laughing : Mate, at least we'll have some incredible stories to share! Can you imagine trying to explain this mess to someone who wasn't here to witness it?

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : authoritative : Art, we need to find a solution for this mayhem. Our staff is completely overwhelmed, and the company could be heading toward a financial disaster.
:: Art : realizing : You're right, Nia. I never expected things to spiral this out of control. We have to pull ourselves together and find a way to restore order to Oddball Industries.

== At the peak of the madness, pandemonium careens out of control in the office as bizarre and idiosyncratic desires of the Oddball characters unfold. Talking cats, cheese-stealing hedgehogs, and an indoor blizzard contribute to the chaos. There's no time for the staff to get work done, with things looking financially dire for their professional futures. Nia and Art realize the importance of regaining control over the situation and decide to restore order to the office.
