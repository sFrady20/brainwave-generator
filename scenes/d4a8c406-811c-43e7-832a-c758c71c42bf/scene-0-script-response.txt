>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : confused : Nia, have you seen this ancient-looking keyboard that's appeared in my office? It seems like someone accidentally left it here, but something about it is really strange.
:: Nia : curious : What's so strange about it, Art? It's just an old keyboard, right?
:: Art : hesitantly : Well, I was typing some nonsense on it just for fun, and suddenly it all started coming true! One of the things I typed was that it would rain cats and dogs inside the office, and then it really did! There were cats and dogs falling from the ceiling! You heard about that earlier, right?

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Marcus, Carmen
:: Rachel : bewildered : Hey, did any of you see the cats and dogs raining inside the office today? That was insane! Art must have done something weird.
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, I saw it. It was absolute madness! Although, it reminded me of this joke: Why don't cats play poker in the jungle? Too many cheetahs!
:: Marcus : laughing : David, that joke is terrible, but I love it! I heard when Art typed on that ancient keyboard, all the nonsense became reality! What an oddball!
:: Carmen : grinning : Imagine the possibilities! We could have so much fun with that keyboard. Say, who's up for making it rain cheeseburgers?

>> [20] > 3/6 - Liam, Devika, Marko
:: Liam : conspiratorially : So guys, now that we know about Art's magical keyboard, what if we get our hands on it and use it to our advantage? I'm sure we could come up with some crazy things to make happen around here!
:: Devika : mischievously : Oh, I'm in! How about we make it so everyone's computer mouse turns into an actual live mouse? That'd be hilarious!
:: Marko : excited : I've got one! How about making the photocopier print out pictures of Frank, my pet goldfish? That would really throw people off!

>> [13] > 3/3 - Carmen, Nia, Samantha
:: Nia : concerned : You know, with the mayhem we've already seen, maybe we should be more careful with this mystical keyboard. We don't want our office to turn into a complete disaster zone.
:: Carmen : reluctantly : You're probably right, Nia. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt, or we lose our jobs because of the chaos.
:: Samantha : stern : Agreed. We need to keep the office environment in check, otherwise, things could spiral out of control.
