>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Liam, Carmen, Marcus
:: Art : excitedly : And there I was, in my office, typing on this magical keyboard, and it started raining cats and dogs! Can you believe it? This little thing has some incredible power!
:: Liam : scheming : Oh, the things I could do with that keyboard... say, Art, would you mind if I borrowed it for a little, uh, sales presentation I have coming up? I promise I won't go overboard.
:: Carmen : overly-enthusiastic : Art, I need it too! Just imagine all the implausible situations we could put ourselves in! Boss, you've got to let us have a go with that keyboard. It's just too fascinating to pass up!
:: Marcus : grinning : We could immerse ourselves in a world of pure imagination, like sipping champagne on a unicorn while swimming through a sea of jelly donuts. Ah, the possibilities!
>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, David
:: Nia : concerned : David, we can't let everyone near that keyboard. It's a recipe for disaster. If we're not careful, our office will turn into anarchy! We need to come up with a plan to keep things in check.
:: David : chuckling : Oh, Nia, come on! It's all in good fun. Besides, you have to admit, it was pretty hilarious to see Art being chased by a talking sandwich earlier today. A little chaos never hurt anyone.
>> [19] > 3/3 - Nia, Liam, Art
:: Nia : sternly : Art, we need some ground rules when it comes to that keyboard. We can't have everyone typing nonsense and making it come true, or productivity will plummet. Not to mention the safety hazards!
:: Liam : smirking : Now, now, Nia. Don't be such a buzzkill. What are you afraid of? Getting trapped in a giant hamster ball rolling through the office? 
:: Art : sheepishly : She does have a point, Liam. As amusing as it is, we can't let this magic keyboard disrupt our entire operation. We need to find a way to control its use, or we might end up in a heap of trouble.
== In this act, the news of the keyboard's abilities spreads and the characters become desperate to use it for their own gain. Art finds himself overwhelmed by the requests, while Nia pushes for some boundaries and control over the situation. Light-hearted banter and silly ideas of what they could do with the keyboard drive the conversation. The act captures the rising tension and chaos around the office as everyone vies to use the mystical keyboard.
