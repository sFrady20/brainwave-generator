>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Art, David, Marcus
:: Nia : serious : Okay, everyone, gather around. We need to address the chaos that's unfolding around the office, thanks to Art's mystical keyboard. In order to restore some semblance of order, we need to devise a fair management system for the keyboard's usage. Any suggestions?
:: Art : concerned : Nia, I agree. The last thing I wanted was for this mysterious keyboard to cause so much trouble. I never thought my mystical typing adventures would turn our office into a madhouse!
:: David : smirking : You know, Nia, back in the day, we used to draw straws to decide who got to use the last donut. Not that it's a perfect system, but just throwing out ideas here.
:: Marcus : grinning : Or we could have an Oddball Olympics, where each of us competes in a series of bizarre challenges for the right to harness the keyboard's power. Like a game of "who can hold their breath the longest while reciting the national anthem backward!"

>> [15] > 5/5 - Carmen, Liam, Rachel, Devika, Marko
:: Carmen : amused : Oddball Olympics? That sounds like a riot, but let's not forget we need to restore order, not create more chaos. Plus, who's going to judge these bizarre challenges, anyway? A talking cat?
:: Liam : chuckling : I won't lie, I like the sound of that! Though, I guess the point is to fix things around here.
:: Rachel : thoughtful : What if we created a schedule? Each person gets a certain amount of time with the keyboard each day, and we can plan our wishes accordingly. That way, everyone has equal access and we avoid an all-out war.
:: Devika : nodding : A schedule seems fair. We can even have a rule that states if you cause any damage or disruption with your wishes, you lose your turn on the keyboard.
:: Marko : smirking : As long as there's a designated time for repairing the damage already done, like, you know, getting rid of the talking cats and cheese-stealing hedgehogs running around.

== In this act, Nia devises a method to organize the fight for the keyboard by proposing a fair management system for its usage. The Oddball team comes together to discuss different ways to share the mysticism of the keyboard. They eventually settle on a scheduling system to avoid further chaos and ensure equal access for everyone. The string of ludicrous and funny debacles stemming from mystical wish-based desires continue, even culminating in property damage. However, the team makes rules to encourage responsibility and consequences for their wishes.
