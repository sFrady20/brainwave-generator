>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Nia, Liam, Rachel
:: Nia : stern : Okay, team, our office is in chaos! It's time we put an end to this madness and return to some semblance of productivity. Art, we know you never meant for this to happen, but the power of the keyboard has proven too great for us.
:: Art : apologetic : You're right, Nia. I didn't think we'd lose our heads like this. But now our office is basically an insane asylum. I'll take responsibility for this mess, and I think it's time for us to say goodbye to the magical keyboard.
:: Liam : reluctantly : Yeah, I guess I don't need that army of monkeys making me custom suits after all. It was a fun dream, though.
:: Rachel : nostalgically : I'll definitely miss my personal hair-fan to give me that wind-swept look, but if it brings back our sanity, it's worth the sacrifice.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, David, Carmen, Devika
:: Art : enthusiastic : All right! Now that we've all agreed to move on from our keyboard shenanigans, let's clean up this mess together and get back to being Oddball Industries! To celebrate our return to normalcy, I propose a little farewell party right here in the break room!
:: David : snickering : Can we keep the indoor snowstorm room, though? It's a nice place to chill during lunch breaks.
:: Nia : scolding : David, we're trying to get the office back in order, not keep our distractions around.
:: Carmen : giggling : I will admit, though, the talking cats were a hoot. I don't think I'll ever get tired of hearing them debate the merits of different brands of catnip.
:: Devika : smirking : Yeah, but remember that time when they started a catnip war? Fluff and chaos everywhere! It's time we put an end to these distractions and focus on our work again.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : determined : So, it's settled. We give up the power of the mystical keyboard and work together to clean up the mess we've created. It was a crazy ride, but now it's time to buckle down and get back to what we do best.
:: Nia : approving : I couldn't agree more, Art. Our office may never be the same after this, but at least we learned a valuable lesson about the importance of self-control and teamwork.
:: Marcus : amused : And hey, we'll always have the memories and the scars from our strange little adventures. Here's to a more focused and slightly less magical future!

== Art takes responsibility for the chaos caused by the keyboard and the team agrees to return it, ending their wild era of wish fulfillment. The Oddball team cleans up the mess and holds a farewell party in the break room to celebrate a fresh start. They now move forward with a new appreciation for teamwork and self-control. Art disposes of the magical keyboard, and Oddball Industries returns to its usual, non-magical state of affairs.
