>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Carmen, Nia, Liam
:: Marcus : excited : I've got the perfect idea to top David's strange scenarios! We'll create a scene where he's surrounded by stacks upon stacks of donuts, but can't eat them because they're all digitally pixelated!
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, that's genius, Marcus! I can just picture the look of horror on his face as he tries to eat those pixelated sweets. What if we throw in some internet meme references to add to the absurdity?
:: Nia : amused : You two are incorrigible, but I have to admit, I'm starting to enjoy this little game of one-upping each other's weird situations. Just make sure it doesn't get out of hand, and we don't end up causing any actual harm.
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, come on, Nia. What's the worst that could happen? It's all harmless fun, and besides, we're teaching David a valuable lesson about not trying to manipulate his coworkers for personal gain. Or, at least, not being so obvious about it.
:: Marcus : musing : I've got it! We'll also add in a fake email chain that talks about a secret donut-based cryptocurrency. David won't know what hit him!

>> [5] > 3/3 - Rachel, Devika, David
:: Rachel : giggling : And then, Marcus created this pixelated donut mountain, and David's face nearly turned purple from the confusion!
:: Devika : joining the laughter : Oh, that's brilliant! I've got an idea to add to the madness. What if we make a fake office memo about needing to complete a mandatory online course on the proper consumption of digital food?
:: David : nervously laughing : Haha, you guys are hilarious. I never thought my little inception plan would turn into such a wild ride. But hey, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right? Next thing you know, we'll have virtual cats invading the office, reminding everyone to take their digital snack breaks.

== The act showcases an escalating competition between coworkers to create the most bizarre and over-the-top dreamlike situations, as a response to David's initial inception plan. Marcus and Carmen are leading the charge, with ideas such as a pixelated donut mountain and secret donut-based cryptocurrency. Other coworkers, like Rachel and Devika, join in the fun, contributing ideas like a fake office memo about mandatory digital food consumption training. There's plenty of edgy humor and irreverent banter as the situations spiral out of control in this act.
