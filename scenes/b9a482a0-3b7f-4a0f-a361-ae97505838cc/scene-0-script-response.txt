>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Liam, Marcus
:: David : excited : Guys, I have the greatest idea to get my name on everyone's lips and score the Employee of the Month. I watched "Inception" last night and it got me thinking. What if I create bizarre scenes and situations around the office, so everyone starts relating them with me? I mean, it's genius, right?
:: Liam : smirking : David, buddy, you do realize we've all seen "Inception," right? But hey, if you really want to go down that rabbit hole, be my guest. I'm curious to see how this plays out.
:: Marcus : laughing : David, my man, you never cease to amaze me with your absurdity. But alright, let's see how deep into the Oddball dream world we can go!

>> [9] > 3/3 - Art, Michael, Samantha
:: Art : chuckling : Have you heard about David's harebrained scheme? He thinks planting bizarre scenes around the office will get everyone talking about him and win him Employee of the Month.
:: Michael : grinning : Oh, that's just precious. And he doesn't even know we've all seen "Inception." We should play along and make this even wilder than he could possibly imagine.
:: Samantha : smirking : Playing along sounds like a deviously delightful idea. It's time to pull out our best acting chops and unravel this dreamlike scenario till it spins out of control.

>> [3] > 3/3 - Marcus, Liam, David
:: Marcus : encouragingly : David, I've got to say, I'm impressed with your dedication to this scheme. I mean, stacking boxes in the storage room like a labyrinth? That's some next-level commitment.
:: Liam : sarcastically : Oh yes, David. Watching you play out these insane scenes with a straight face is truly a sight to behold. Bravo!
:: David : defensively : Well, I'm going all in on this, guys! I'm going to create scenes so bizarre that everyone will be talking about me for weeks. They'll have no choice but to vote for me as Employee of the Month!
