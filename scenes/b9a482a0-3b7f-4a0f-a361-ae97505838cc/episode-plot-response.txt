title: Oddballception: Descending the Corporate Layers
exposition: Employee of the month voting is next week and everyone is pulling their best foot forward to score as high as possible. Inspired by seeing the movie "Inception," David Kent devises an overly complicated scheme that he thinks will nudge him up onto the voting list: plant bizarre fictional scenes around the office to inspire dreamlike sequences for his co-workers to relate with his name becoming a common topic of office discussion - little does he know, everyone in the office has seen "Inception."

rising action: David orchestrates awkward dream-inspired moments around his coworkers attempting to play with their minds, from arranging random boxes in the storage room meant to symbolize a labyrinth, pretending to act violently (yet hilariously) at the water cooler, and playing distorted white noise outside the women's restroom. The other workers start to notice, and instead of getting perturbed or mystified, they play along, causing even stranger events and occurrences as a joke or to turn it against David.

climax: Each newly invented scene builds on each other, spiraling into chaos where each coworker is now in a competition to create even weirder situations than the previous one. Marcus and Carmen discover their creativity peaks when they stage over-the-top inappropriate situations secretly twisting David’s initial inception intent into a running buzz of clumsy encores performed by David replicating extreme panic-inducing actions.

falling action: Everyone in the office has contributed to the twisted Intera-series-spection disarray that built around these incidents, while David struggles to absorb and finger point on who responded to his craft in order to get answers. During a last-ditch false emergency intervention set up by Mike and Sam, Art Beecham steps deep into the backroom to meditate upon employees trying figuring out the right note to self-cover.

resolution: In the end, everyone gleefully unveils the grand truth behind this spiraling web of dreamlike shocks to David who stands agape, and chuckles latching the classic collective pun. Managers snip him off employee-of-the-monthing it but praise everyone warming around him for not losing a precious mentoring given as how to remain tied to reality under pressing situation demands. Sadly for Sam, in the commotion of celebrating the revelations, none of the voters realizes voting nominations went rescheduled again, leaving Devika Sharma with easily sweeping title. Situations partially return to normal. But this doesn’t stand the trouble signalized: Oddball fantasy does exist, and can also cast its entwining hold beyond oneself in order to stir a company’s mettle … infesting … hovering … twerkable.
