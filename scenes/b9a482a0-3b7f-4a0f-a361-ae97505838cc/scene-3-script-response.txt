>> [21] > 2/2 - Mike, Sam
:: Mike : grinning : Sam, I just had the most fantastic idea! What if we stage a fake emergency to see how everyone reacts? You know, just to stir things up and confuse David even more?
:: Sam : smirking : Mike, that's a crazy idea, but it might just work! It could throw David for a loop and give us a chance to see if he's really caught onto the game we're playing here. Let's make it convincing, too! We don't want him to figure it out too quickly.

>> [6] > 3/3 - Art, Marcus, Liam
:: Art : pondering : I've been noticing these bizarre events happening all over the office. It's like everyone's lost their minds! Marcus, Liam, do you guys have any clue what's going on?
:: Marcus : chuckling : Art, my good sir, I have a little hunch, but I can't say for sure. It seems like there's a contagious case of dreamlike shenanigans spreading through Oddball Industries!
:: Liam : grinning : Yeah, and it all started with David's odd attempt to create an inception-like experience for us. But now it seems like it's taken on a life of its own!

>> [20] > 4/6 - Nia, Devika, Rachel, Carmen
:: Nia : laughing : I can't believe we've all gotten so invested in this Intera-series-spection madness! The office has turned into an absurd wonderland, all because of David's misguided plan!
:: Devika : amused : I must admit, it's been a nice distraction from the usual office routine. I mean, I never thought I'd see the day I could use a pixelated donut as currency!
:: Rachel : giggling : And don't forget about that fake office memo about mandatory digital food consumption training! That one had me rolling on the floor with laughter! It's almost a shame that this will all come to an end soon.
:: Carmen : smirking : Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about that, Rachel. We Oddballs have a knack for finding new ways to keep things interesting around here!

>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Mike, Sam, Rachel
:: David : frustrated : Guys, I can't take it anymore! All these bizarre events happening one after the other, it's driving me insane! I mean, I knew I started it, but I didn't expect it to spiral this much out of control!
:: Mike : snickering : Well, David, you know what they say: be careful what you wish for! But don't worry, buddy, we're all in this together. We've got your back.
:: Sam : smirking : Yeah, David! Just think of it as a team-building exercise. We're all learning more about each other and how we manage stress in these extraordinary circumstances. It's...educational!
:: Rachel : laughing : That's right, David! You've inadvertently given us a lesson in embracing the unexpected and thriving in chaos. So, really, you've done us all a favor!

== In this act, David struggles to figure out how everyone in the office has responded to his inception plan, while Oddball Industries employees continue to create bizarre dreamlike situations. Art, curious about the strange events, consults Marcus and Liam, who reveal the inception plan managed to spiral out of control into something much bigger. Nia, Devika, Rachel, and Carmen discuss how the whole situation has been a fun distraction from their typical work routine. In the final scene, Mike, Sam, and Rachel reassure David that they are all in this together and have learned valuable lessons from the chaos.
