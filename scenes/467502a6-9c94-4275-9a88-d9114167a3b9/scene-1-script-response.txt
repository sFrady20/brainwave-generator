>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, David, Rachel, Marcus
:: Liam : boastful : Alright, everyone, gather 'round. We've got the task of coming up with some seriously savage one-liners and zingers for this Musk roast. I expect nothing less than the verbal guillotine.
:: David : snickering : Well, Liam, you know, the guillotine is more of a "cutting-edge" device, and we're going for the more "shock-and-awe" approach, but I get what you mean.
:: Rachel : chiming in : Just imagine the look on Musk's face when he hears our jokes! We'll have the whole world laughing at our roast! 
:: Marcus : grinning : We'll be the talk of the town, or even the world! Our wits, like thunderbolts, shall pierce the armor of his ego and send him reeling!
 
>> [8] > 3/3 - Devika, Carmen, Marko
:: Devika : brainstorming : Okay, guys, we can't let the others outshine us. We need to come up with some witty, biting, and maybe even tech-related burns for our dear Elon.
:: Carmen : smirking : Oh, I've got one! How about: "Elon, your dating life is like your rockets - always trying to get off the ground, but they keep coming back to Earth!"
:: Marko : laughing : That's a good one! Or how about: "Elon, you're so obsessed with Mars that even your cologne smells like Martian soil!" 

>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Sam
:: Nia : concerned : I'm not sure if this whole roasting idea is a good thing. It might reflect poorly on the company, don't you think? 
:: Sam : stern : Yeah, but isn't that the point of a roast? Pushing boundaries and having a laugh? As long as it doesn't get out of hand, I think it could be entertaining.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Devika, Marcus, Marko, Carmen, Rachel
:: Devika : competitive : Alright, everyone. It's time to put our best jokes forward and see who has the sharpest wit in Oddball Industries!
:: Marcus : boastful : Prepare yourselves for a battle of wits, where only the funniest will emerge victorious and the lesser jesters shall hang their heads in shame!
:: Marko : excited : This is going to be epic! Now, let the battle commence!
:: Carmen : confident : Trust me, you guys won't know what hit you when I start dishing out my zingers!
:: Rachel : eager : Let the roast wars begin and may the best team win!
