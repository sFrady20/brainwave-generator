>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, Marcus, David
:: Rachel : excited : Can you believe it, guys? Elon Musk is actually visiting our office! I was thinking, what if we host a preemptive roast of him, you know, like those Comedy Central ones? It could go viral and drive traffic to our future office events!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh, Rachel, that's a splendid idea! Just imagine the possibilities: poking fun at a man who launched a car into space, digs tunnels, and tweets wild stuff! The internet would go bananas!
:: David : pondering : You know, it's a bit oddball, but it could work. We'd need some razor-sharp jokes, though. We can't go easy on him; we have to give it our all!

>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, Carmen
:: Liam : smirking : So, I heard about this Elon Musk roast idea. I'm pretty sure I can come up with some killer jokes. I mean, this guy named a flamethrower "Not a Flamethrower," he's practically begging to be roasted!
:: Carmen : grinning : Oh, count me in too! I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to poke fun at the guy who tried to name his kid using a math equation! There's too much gold in here to let it pass!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Devika, Marko
:: Nia : curious : So, Devika, Marko, how do you feel about joining the roast committee for our big Elon Musk event? We need some top-notch jokes, and I think you two have the wit for it.
:: Devika : smiling : I'll give it a shot, Nia. I bet I can come up with some out-of-the-box zingers that'll leave everyone, including Mr. Musk, speechless!
:: Marko : enthusiastic : Mate, I'm all in! I've got stories about Frank, my goldfish, that'll leave Elon in stitches! I mean, sure, they have nothing to do with him, but everyone loves a good fish tale, right?
