>> [11] > 3/4 - Carmen, Marcus, Rachel
:: Carmen : smirking : I genuinely thought my Egyptian Muppet Queen joke would be the showstopper. Who knew Elon Musk would find our collective train wreck so amusing?

:: Rachel : nodding : You're right, Marcus. It's comforting to know that, even in the face of utter humiliation, we can still laugh at ourselves and stick together.

:: Nia : shrugging : Well, that was an experience for the books. Next time, let's leave the roasting to the professionals or at least get some Toastmasters classes around here.
:: Devika : grinning : It's the insane moments like these that make working at Oddball Industries so memorable. We tried to roast Musk, but in the end, we roasted ourselves!
:: Art : chuckling : I couldn't agree more. We may not have achieved our goal, but we did learn that we can find humor in even the most ridiculous of situations.

>> [5] > 2/3 - Marko, Sam
:: Marko : laughing : I still can't believe we tried to roast Elon Musk. Honestly, I thought my joke about him running on Martian time would have been a hit.
