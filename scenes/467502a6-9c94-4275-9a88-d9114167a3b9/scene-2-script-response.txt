>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Rachel, Carmen
:: Marcus : giddy : My friends, Elon Musk's imminent arrival has set these hallowed halls abuzz! This roast will surely go down in history, but we need a fitting audience. I propose we scour our vast networks to find the perfect guests for this prestigious event!
:: David : nervously : I've been plumbing the depths of my Facebook friends list, but it seems everyone's busy watching that viral video of a hamster eating a burrito. We might have to resort to inviting... strangers!
:: Rachel : determined : I've got it! I'll text my cousin Vinny, he's always hanging out with an eclectic bunch of characters. They'll definitely add an air of... unpredictability to the proceedings.
:: Carmen : teasing : Oh, Rachel, I can't imagine what this motley crew will look like. You think they'll be able to understand our intricate, cutting words? Or will they be too busy discussing their favorite memes from four years ago?

>> [15] > 5/5 - Liam, Devika, Nia, Sam, Art
:: Liam : smug : Devika, your team's jokes are weaker than the coffee in our break room. Our roast-lord status is near mythic, and you're struggling to get off the ground!
:: Devika : defiant : My team's punchlines are top-notch, Liam, just wait until the real deal begins! Your inflated ego will be deflated faster than you can say "reusable rocket."
:: Nia : stern : Both of you, enough bickering! We should be focusing on delivering the most memorable roast possible, not constantly trying to one-up each other. Remember, we're all in this together.
:: Sam : deadpan : I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be eagerly awaiting a roast of Elon Musk. Yet, here I am, secretly hoping the punchlines will be so brutal that even my mother-in-law would wince.
:: Art : chuckling : Well, at least one thing's for certain: we've certainly got a colorful cast of characters to make this event unforgettable!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Elon, Art, Nia
:: Elon : stoically : I must say, I'm intrigued by the fact that a software company is hosting a roast in my honor. This is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.
:: Art : proudly : Elon, my boy, here at Oddball Industries we pride ourselves on being... well, odd. It's part of our charm, and we hope you'll find it... endearing.
:: Nia : diplomatically : We've all been working tirelessly to ensure that this event is both entertaining and memorable. We hope that you'll find our collective wit a fitting tribute to your many accomplishments... and eccentricities.

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Devika, Liam
:: Marko : chuckling : Mate, I just saw Rachel's cousin Vinny and his friends walk in. Crikey, they look like they've just stepped off the set of a reality TV show!
:: Devika : playful : Well, I guess they'll fit right in with the rest of the chaos we've got going on here today. Let's just hope their taste in humor is as questionable as their fashion choices.
:: Liam : smirking : You know, I might just invite them to our next sales meeting. It's about time we added some extra color to our monthly dose of "sales target panic."
