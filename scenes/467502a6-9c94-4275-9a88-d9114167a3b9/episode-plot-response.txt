title: Musk's Misfire
exposition: Oddball Industries is blindsided when gossip mill mogul Elon Musk plans on visiting the quiet office for a day. Realizing the potential to cash in on the unconventional visitor, Rachel puts together a groundbreaking thing: a preemptive "roast" of Elon Musk believing it will go viral and drive traffic to their office-held events in future. With rumors swirling of Musk adding a few words at the end, the employees dive headfirst into the preparations for picking him apart.

rising action: The employees split into committees led by the top four sharpest wits: Liam, Devika, Marcus, and Carmen. These sultans of sarcasm strive to craft a wordier competitor to the guillotine. But as the battle for the best back-handed compliment rages on, lines are drawn and petty feuds erupt, throwing the office into chaos.

climax: Elon Musk finally arrives at the office roast, catching the employees off guard. Desperate for guests to fill in the time needed for skim reading auto-biographies, they turn to outsiders. Elon nevertheless seems to react stoically during the event as oddball insults fail to hit the mark as the picked roast-lords relent on past barriers.

falling action: As the teams reassemble and awkwardly withdraw their punchlines, their relief gives way to disbelief as the great Elon Musk doubles over from laughter. The previous excitement and team rivalry to impress and savagely roast Musk is replaced as plans they had turn full circle at ultra-high tech diction slapdown extravaganza never takes off.

resolution: Confused, ashamed, and cursing the lack of office Toastmasters classes, the employees apologize to each other for resorting so fast to be drawn into twists life sometimes propounds. They all go into a tight huddle about the stranger that grasps their day forcefully and reinterprets introverted selves to seek resiliency not to wince from criticisms. At the water cooler the next morning, morale ticks up the "fun" levels more raucously recounting tales from an Egyptian Muppet Queen. Elon placed on office agenda: Musk-apprehended.
