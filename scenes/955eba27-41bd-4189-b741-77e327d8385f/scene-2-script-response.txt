>> [15] > 5/5 - David, Sam, Marcus, Rachel, Carmen
:: David : excited : Alright, everyone, gather 'round! I have successfully channeled the spirit of none other than Princess Purrsalot, the cat ghost! Behold, her ethereal presence is among us.
:: Sam : nervous : Uh, are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, I'm not really a cat person, you know.
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh, Sam, you're in for a treat! Princess Purrsalot is sure to give you a totally new perspective on feline spirits. Behold her otherworldly charm!
:: Rachel : sarcastic : Oh great, just what we needed, a haunted cat. Maybe we can do some cat-astrophic damage with this newfound paranormal knowledge.
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, Rachel, your puns are just purr-fect! But seriously, let's see if our cat-fearing guardian here can bond with a ghost cat. It's going to be a meow-tain of fun!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Arthur, Liam, Nia
:: Arthur : concerned : Liam, I've been hearing rumors about this Ouija board session you've planned. Is it true? Are you all dabbling in the paranormal?
:: Liam : mischievous : Oh, come on, Art! It's all in good fun! We're just trying to see if we have any hidden supernatural talents. You know, like bending spoons with our minds and stuff.
:: Nia : skeptical : Liam, while it's all fun and games to you, we can't forget we're here to run a business. I don't think Art would like to see our office turned into a haunted house.

>> [15] > 5/5 - David, Sam, Marcus, Rachel, Carmen
:: David : earnest : Fear not, Sam! Princess Purrsalot is a magnanimous spirit. She brings good fortune and the power of levitating office supplies!
:: Sam : panicking : Levitating office supplies? Are you all trying to get me fired? I can't handle this!
:: Marcus : soothing : Relax, Sam, it's just a bit of otherworldly entertainment. We'll keep the ghostly shenanigans to a minimum, I promise.
:: Rachel : smirking : Yeah, we wouldn't want any pens to go flying and poke someone's eye out, now would we?
:: Carmen : giggling : Nope, we'd much rather save that for our next office prank war!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Arthur, Liam, Nia
:: Arthur : stern : Listen, Liam, while I can appreciate a bit of playful spirit – no pun intended – around here, I don't want Oddball Industries to become the next paranormal hotspot. Let's stick to our actual jobs, okay?
:: Liam : defeated : Alright, Art. I get it, no more Ouija board shenanigans. But it was worth a shot!
:: Nia : relieved : Thank you, Art. Now, let's get back to work and put this spectral nonsense behind us.
