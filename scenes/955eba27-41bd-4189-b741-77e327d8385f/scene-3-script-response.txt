>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, David, Carmen
:: Nia : confused : What on earth am I witnessing here? Is this some sort of supernatural tea party? 
:: David : nervously laughing : Oh, hey Nia! We were just, um, trying to make friends with Princess Purrsalot, the cat ghost. You know, the more spirits on our side, the better, right? 
:: Carmen : chuckling : Yeah, we figured that if we can't beat the competition with our brains, maybe some paranormal help would do the trick!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Marcus, Rachel, Devika
:: Liam : smirking : So guys, how's your spirit summoning going? I've managed to get in touch with a long-lost uncle who's got some hot stock tips!
:: Marcus : rolling eyes : Liam, you're always looking for shortcuts. We should be focusing on genuine connections with the spirits, not just trying to profit off them.
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, because that's so much more reasonable, right? We're just chatting with ghosts in the break room like it's a normal Tuesday.
:: Devika : grinning : Yeah, next thing you know, we'll be having seances during our lunch break and summoning the ghost of Steve Jobs for product advice.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Arthur, Nia, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Arthur : stern : Alright everyone, enough with these paranormal shenanigans! We need to focus on the work at hand.
:: Nia : relieved : Thank you, Arthur. It was getting a bit out of hand. Besides, we have more pressing matters to deal with, like our next quarter's revenue.
:: David : reluctant : You're right, Nia. I guess it's time to let go of our spectral friends and get back to reality.
:: Carmen : joking : Aww, but I was just getting used to having coffee with Casper the Friendly Ghost!
:: Marcus : smirking : Don't worry, Carmen. I'm sure our otherworldly pals will be watching over us, ready to lend a spectral hand when needed.
