:: Liam : excited : Can you believe all the dull days we've had around here lately? I've been thinking... What if we spice things up a little by having a supernatural ability showdown to see who's got the most hidden talents?
:: Marcus : intrigued : You mean like a psychic contest? I'm all for it, mate! I've always believed that there's more to life than meets the eye.

>> [15] > 4/5 - Liam, Marcus, David, Rachel
:: Liam : smirking : Behold! I've brought this Ouija board into the break room. We can conjure up spirits while waiting for our coffee. Let the supernatural showdown begin!
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : Now that's what I'm talking about! Let's channel our inner mystics and see who has the strongest connection to the other side.
:: David : chuckling : I can't believe I'm going along with this, but sure, why not? Let's see what the spirits have to say.
:: Rachel : skeptical : You guys are seriously going to try to talk to ghosts with a Ouija board? Whatever, as long as it doesn't interfere with my coffee break.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Carmen, David, Nia
:: Carmen : gossiping : Have you heard? Liam brought a Ouija board to the break room, and now people are competing to see who's the most psychic around here.
:: David : laughing : Yeah, I'm in on the madness. Who knew trying to contact the dead could liven up the office so much?
:: Nia : disapproving : This really isn't a productive use of company time, but I have to admit, it's been quite entertaining to see everyone let loose for a change.

:: Marcus : excited : I can't wait to see what we find, or rather, who we find. Prepare to be amazed, gang!
:: David : joking : If we end up talking to the ghost of an accountant, can they help us with our taxes?
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Yeah, because that's exactly what ghosts want to do – help us save money on taxes.
:: Devika : curious : I'm not a believer in this sort of thing, but it's fascinating to see how people get so caught up in it. I just hope nobody takes it too seriously.
