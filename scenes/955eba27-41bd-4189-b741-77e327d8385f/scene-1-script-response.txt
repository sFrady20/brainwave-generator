>> [15] > 3/5 - Liam, Marcus, Rachel
:: Liam : excited : You know what, guys? I've been thinking we need a new way to spice up our work lives. Something to get everyone's blood pumping and really bring the office together. Who's up for a little paranormal challenge using that Ouija board in the break room?
:: Marcus : laughing : Liam, you devilish trickster! You really know how to stir the pot, don't you? But a Ouija board in the break room? Who knows what spirits we might awaken!
:: Rachel : hesitantly : I've never been one for supernatural stuff, but if it's just for fun, I might give it a shot. Who could resist a little excitement in this mundane office?

>> [11] > 3/4 - Carmen, David, Nia
:: Carmen : intrigued : So, Liam's got this idea to use a Ouija board in the break room to test our paranormal talents. Sounds crazy, right?
:: David : chuckling : Crazy? Absolutely! But so is dealing with the copier machine. Count me in for this wild psychic showdown. Can't wait to see what spirits have to say about my puns!
:: Nia : concerned : I'm not sure I'm comfortable with encouraging such superstitious behavior, but as long as it doesn't affect productivity, I suppose it's harmless enough. Just remember, we have work to do, people.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Devika, Arthur, Marko
:: Devika : eagerly : Guys, I heard about the Ouija board plan! I think it's a fantastic way to tap into our hidden potential. I'm definitely in!
:: Arthur : worried : Devika, are you sure it's wise to dabble in these supernatural matters? I wouldn't want Oddball Industries to be haunted by some unfriendly spirit.
:: Marko : grinning : Aw, come on, Art! Don't be such a scaredy-cat. We're just having a bit of fun. What could possibly go wrong, mate?
