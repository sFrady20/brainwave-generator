title: Caturday Nightcaster
exposition: Liam, seeking some excitement, randomly comes up with a new challenge - to test their office colleagues on their supernatural abilities and knowledge. Unbeknownst to everyone else, he plants a Ouija board in the break room in order to channel spirits while they wait for their coffee.

rising action: Liam reveals his idea to other coworkers, setting the stage for an office-wide Ouija board session under the belief that success will lead to competitive paranormal talents. While some skeptics back away, others daringly participate in wildly baffling psychic showdowns, intensifying the competitiveness of those involved.

climax: In one exceptionally ridiculous round, David channels a cat ghost, Princess Purrsalot, to encourage Sam (the cat-fearing security guard) to bond with their ethereal visitor. Meanwhile, Arthur is informed of the Ouija board shenanigans, and he's worried that Oddball Industries would dabble in these spooky territories.

falling action: As everyone rallies to exercise unforeseen powers in the hopes of spirit insurance against failure, Nia unwittingly stumbles upon the scene, witnessing people conspiring to control intangibles and supernatural forces, grasping at paranormal straws.

resolution: Chastened by her horrified reaction, the participants make the brave move of admitting defeat, phasing out their woowoo nonsense while realizing that no talisman or paranormal force can save Oddball’s next quarter from low revenues. With the spirits released and sanity installed, this wild cat and Ouija infused Caturday Nightcaster deceptively crawls away back into 1990s abyss - but deep down in their experiences, employees passionately resist returning graveyards to their watering holes.
