>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Marcus, Carmen, Liam
:: Nia : stern : Alright, everyone. We've had our fun with the Ouija boards and cat ghosts, but it's time to get back to reality. We have a company to run, and no amount of supernatural nonsense is going to save us from low revenues.
:: Marcus : chuckling : Well, it was worth a shot, wasn't it? Besides, I think we all learned something valuable about ourselves in the process. Like how I'm absolutely terrible at channeling spirits!
:: Carmen : amused : Or how we discovered Mike has a hidden talent for cat whispering. Who knew?
:: Liam : smirking : Sure, we got a bit carried away, but it's not every day you get to challenge yourself to a paranormal duel at work, right? I guess it's time to hang up my psychic hat and get back to making sales. 

>> [2] > 2/2 - David, Marko
:: David : laughing : I can't believe we actually let Liam talk us into that whole Ouija board fiasco. I mean, I almost convinced myself I could summon a cat ghost named Princess Purrsalot. How ridiculous is that?
:: Marko : grinning : Mate, it was a wild ride for everyone. But hey, at least we can say we tried something new, right? Now it's back to the grindstone for us. Although, I'm still not sure how Sam manages to be afraid of even ghost cats.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Rachel
:: Art : concerned : So, Nia, you're saying that we're all done with the paranormal shenanigans? I want to make sure Oddball Industries doesn't get a reputation for being some sort of...ghostbusters office.
:: Nia : assertive : Yes, Art, I've made it clear to everyone that we need to focus on actual work and leave the supernatural games behind. We have a quarter to save, and we can't afford any more distractions.
:: Rachel : sheepish : I must admit, though, it's been fun seeing everyone so invested in something so out-of-the-box. I mean, who would've thought that Devika's sneeze would lead to all this mayhem?
:: Art : chuckling : Well, let's just hope we can put this behind us and learn from it. We've got a company to run, after all.
