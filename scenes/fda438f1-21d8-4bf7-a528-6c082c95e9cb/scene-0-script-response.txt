>> [11] > 4/4 - Carmen, David, Marcus, Nia
:: Carmen : excited : Hey guys, you won't believe what I just found on my computer! It's an old "Botspeaks!" app, a relic from the early days of AI. You remember those, right?
:: David : amused : Oh, yeah! Those things were all the rage back in the day. They were supposed to predict the future or something, right?
:: Marcus : intrigued : Indeed, I do recall those fanciful claims. Seems to me they were just a load of nonsense, though. But what does that app have to say?
:: Carmen : grinning : Well, I haven't tried it yet, but I thought it'd be fun to fire it up and see what kind of ridiculous predictions it makes! It claims to provide insights into unsolved mysteries, which is just absurd, don't you think?
:: Nia : laughing : Honestly, that sounds like a hoot! I can only imagine the kind of bizarre and nonsensical things it might come up with. Let's give it a try and see what happens.

:: Marcus : grinning : I'm positively tingling with anticipation! What if it's going to predict our lunch order for tomorrow, or how many emails we'll get today?
:: Rachel : chuckling : Oh, please. Like that's going to be of any help. But hey, why not? Let's have a laugh and see what nonsense it spews out.
