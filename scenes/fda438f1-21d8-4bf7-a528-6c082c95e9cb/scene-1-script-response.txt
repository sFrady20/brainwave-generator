>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Carmen, David
:: Nia : curious : So, Carmen, tell us more about this "Botspeaks!" app. How exactly does it claim to predict the future, and why haven't I heard of this before?
:: Carmen : excited : Well, Nia, it was a big thing during the early days of AI. People would input random questions and get these cryptic riddle-like messages in response. It was all just for fun, but some folks swore by the predictions it made. Let me show you how it works.
:: David : jokingly : Oh, this should be good. It's like asking a Magic 8-Ball if we should invest in sunscreen stocks during a solar eclipse. I can't wait to see what kind of absurd answers we get!
:: Liam : smirking : You know, David, that reminds me of the great Sunscreen Conundrum of '98. But we'll save that story for another time. 

>> [5] > 3/3 - Marcus, Rachel, Devika
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : Ladies, gentlemen, and all fellow Oddballs, I present to you the highly scientific and completely legitimate "Unruly Devs Hypothesis" – that within the programming world, there's a hidden order of developers who secretly control the flow of information!
:: Devika : sarcastically : Oh, you mean like the Illuminati for programmers? Sounds legit, Marcus. I'm sure they hold secret meetings in dark basements, wearing hooded robes, and chanting binary code.
:: Rachel : pondering : If we're discussing wild theories, let's discuss one where cat gifs are now the primary form of currency! Can you imagine buying a house with a collection of cat gifs?

>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, David, Art
:: Nia : analyzing : It's fascinating to see the responses the "Botspeaks!" app gives. I can't help but wonder where these concepts come from, though. Are they purely the product of algorithms, or is there some kind of formulated idea behind them?
:: David : smirking : Nia, I'm pretty sure it's just a bunch of random nonsense. I mean, have you seen the one about the secret society of pineapple farmers controlling the weather? That's got to be purely algorithmic.
:: Art : chuckling : Ah, it reminds me of simpler times, when we didn't take everything so seriously. Sometimes, it's fun to entertain the absurd, whether it's algorithmic or formulated. It's a good reminder not to take ourselves too seriously.

== In this act, the employees at Oddball Industries engage with the "Botspeaks!" app, discovering cryptic riddle-like messages that lead to discussions on where concepts originate. They introduce outrageous subjects as a joke, including the Unruly Devs Hypothesis, Sunscreen Conundrum, and a reality where cat gifs hold currency. The team indulges in the absurdity, sharing irreverent banter and enjoying the lighthearted departure from their usual work discussions.
