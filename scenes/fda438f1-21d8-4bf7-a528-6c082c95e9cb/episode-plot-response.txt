title: Tales from the Odd-BOTS
exposition: Carmen discovers an old "Botspeaks!" app on her computer, a relic from AI days gone by. Curiosity grips her, and she tells the team all about it during the group lunch. She mentions the old Bots once claimed to predict the future and provide insight into unsolved mysteries, amusing the other characters.
rising action: One by one, the employees at Oddball Industries fire up the dusty program and submit quips only to discover a cryptic riddle-like message, fanning their curiosity about where concepts originate (Do they belong to algorithms, or formulated ideas?). To take this in jest, they introduce outrageous subjects under discussion, with Marcus pushing about The Unruly Devs Hypothesis, David challenging the Sunscreen Conundrum, and Rachel pondering over reality where cat gifs hold currency.
climax: The team is taken aback when the team discovers that one of Art's long-lost nephew's paint ownership of the entire enterprise may expire precisely at 21'o clock tonight, validating a far-fetched prediction from the outmoded Bot messengers. With paranoia heightened and stakes high, sanity becomes as scarce as reliable advice at Oddball Industries.
falling action: Characters must decode the mystifying Oughtbots discourse before archaic contractual agreements sever their ties to 21st-century progress. Nia runs odd Bot conversations only to unveil strangely assumed conjecture surrounding officious meetings with parallel universe counterparts.
resolution: As the countdown ticks, they realize the only rivalry they endured was inextricable misinterpretation of jovially tangy textual shenanigans covering professional rapport (a hack's rambling musings!), a ridiculous exoneration (merely for free snacks distribution favored by quantum ethereal senior facilitators!), and immaterial assumptions acting as detrimental veneration to creativity bounds derived from beings that fed on nothing but background-free echoes placed atop binary dialects. The comedy unfolds as the Oddballs scrutinize cyberspace belongings only to find nebulous wit in clusters juxtaposing cosmic humor with incalculable algorithms.
