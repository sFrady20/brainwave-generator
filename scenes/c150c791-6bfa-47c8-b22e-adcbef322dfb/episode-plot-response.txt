title: Oddball Battle Royale
exposition: Art overhears his employees passionately discussing a popular online multiplayer battle royale game. Curious about the concept, Art mistakenly believes this is a new way to increase employee productivity and team-building, so he organizes a massive office tournament accessible exclusively from work with a huge mystery prize for the winner.

rising action: News of the tournament and the prize spreads throughout the office like wildfire, and the employees of Oddball Industries scramble to devise their own strategies and form alliances to improve their chances of winning. Old rivalries and unexpected friendships emerge, while Marcus mysteriously recruits some of his colleagues for his "Elite Squad".

climax: The day of the battle royale arrives, every stratum of the office is fired up, even Super Serious Sam who takes her perfect tournament stance as if winning the mysterious prize depends on her life. Chaos ensues as the characters virtually take one another on in increasingly absurd ways. One instance involves Liam's character mischievously launching mayonnaise packets at unsuspecting rivals, providing both literal and metaphorical slippery situations for the teams, much to Devika's frustration.

falling action: The final showdown takes place, pitting Marcus and his Elite Squad against Nia, Devika, and Mike surprisingly synchronized as they clear multiple over the top and downright peculiar in-office traps. However, Marcus collapses dramatically against their new team when he finds out he accidentally set part of his workstation on fire before the game even started.

resolution: The remaining rivals find out that Marcus sabotaging his cubicle causes them to be disqualified leaving Sam as the last person standing claiming the victory. The mysterious prize is revealed to be a giant inflatable llama mascot dressed like Art aimed to make the office atmosphere more entertaining. The oversized festive-fied llama mascot an instant in with the crowd, but they're now wondering if someone hid Sam's winning fireworks as normal office conversations interambitiously alternate with hunt theories.
