>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Nia
:: Marcus : excited : My friends, our time has come! The Elite Squad shall rise and claim victory in this Oddball Battle Royale.
:: David : chuckling : Oh, Marcus! I'm glad to be part of the Elite Squad, but I hope I don't trip up and ruin our chances.
:: Nia : confidently : Well, Marcus, don't get too excited. Because Devika, Mike, and I have been working on some next-level strategies that will leave you all in the dust.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Mike, Devika
:: Art : curious : So, Mike, Devika, you think your team can dethrone Marcus and his Elite Squad in the battle royale?
:: Mike : smirking : Art, you have no idea what we have up our sleeves. This is going to be the most epic showdown Oddball Industries has ever seen!
:: Devika : sarcastically : Yeah, provided we dodge Liam's mayonnaise packet attacks. It's not the most sophisticated tactic, but it might get a few laughs.

>> [20] > 2/2 - Rachel, Carmen
:: Rachel : laughing : Can you believe Liam's mayonnaise packet idea? This whole battle royale is turning into a cartoonish spectacle!
:: Carmen : grinning : I know, right? But I think it's exactly what we need to lighten up the office atmosphere, don't you think?

>> [15] > 5/5 - Nia, Devika, Mike, David, Marcus
:: Nia : determined : All right, everyone, this is it! The final showdown! Remember our strategies and let's show them who's boss!
:: Devika : smirking : And let's just hope we don't end up slipping on mayonnaise packets.
:: Mike : jokingly : Actually, I might just use my secret weapon - my cat pictures. Sam would panic and flee the battlefield!
:: David : nervously : Well, I hope our Elite Squad can pull through. Let's get ready for the madness!
:: Marcus : dramatically : My friends, no matter the outcome, remember that this day will go down in Oddball Industries history as the day we united in the name of the almighty inflatable llama!

>> [12] > 1/1 - Marcus
:: Marcus : worried : Oh no, I think I accidentally set part of my workstation on fire during my pre-showdown prep! Well, that's just great.

== In this act, the final showdown of the Oddball Battle Royale takes place, with Marcus and his Elite Squad facing off against Nia, Devika, and Mike. Laughter and absurd strategies, such as Liam's mayonnaise packets, ensue as the employees engage in cartoonishly ridiculous tactics. However, Marcus collapses dramatically when he discovers that he accidentally set part of his workstation on fire prior to the game, resulting in a surprising turn of events for the battle royale.
