>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Nia : relieved : Well, that was quite the unexpected turn of events! Can't say I expected a massive inflatable llama as the grand prize, but hey, it's better than nothing. Kudos to Sam for outlasting the rest of us!
:: David : chuckling : I'm just glad I didn't set fire to my cubicle like Marcus did! That's one way to leave a lasting impression... or a scorch mark.
:: Carmen : amused : Oh, the llama mascot is perfect for this place! I can't wait to see it standing tall in the office every day, reminding us of this wild tournament.
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, but did you see Sam's winning fireworks? Those things were insane! I wonder who hid them? Really added a touch of explosive excitement to the whole thing.

>> [20] > 6/6 - Rachel, Marcus, Art, Devika, Mike, Sam
:: Rachel : gossiping : So, what do you think about the whole fireworks situation? I can't help but wonder if someone was trying to sabotage the tournament even more.
:: Marcus : defensively : Hey, at least it wasn't me this time! I've learned my lesson about playing with fire, literally.
:: Art : cryptic : I must admit, I didn't expect the fireworks, but it does add a certain flair to the event. The mystery just keeps on growing!
:: Devika : speculating : Maybe the fireworks were a prank by someone who wanted to add a little mayhem to the mix. You know how we all love a good prank at Oddball Industries!
:: Mike : agreeing : Yeah, I wouldn't put it past some of our colleagues to pull a stunt like that. Just hope they don't go too far next time.
:: Sam : nonchalant : Well, all I know is that those fireworks were a great way to mark my unexpected victory. I'll take it, mystery and all!
