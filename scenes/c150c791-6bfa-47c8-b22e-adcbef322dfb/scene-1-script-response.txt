>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Devika, Carmen
:: Nia : chuckling : So I heard Art's gone off the deep end with this battle royale idea. I've got half a mind to form an alliance and show these newbies who's boss at Oddball.
:: David : amused : Nia, you're a force to be reckoned with! But watch out, I've been practicing my mayonnaise packet launching skills, I might just surprise you.
:: Devika : playfully mocking : Oh, David and his mayonnaise packets. It's going to be a slippery ride to the top. I'm more of a solo player, but I'd love to see how this pans out.
:: Carmen : grinning : Count me in, Nia! Together, we can conquer the virtual world and claim that mystery prize! And maybe, just maybe, I'll share a piece of the glory with you, David.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Rachel, Liam, Marcus, Marko, Mike
:: Rachel : excited : Did you guys hear about the battle royale? I've got my eyes set on that mystery prize! I just hope it's not another inflatable llama dressed like Art.
:: Liam : smirking : Well, I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to taking you all down with my cunning strategies and irresistible charm.
:: Marcus : mysterious : That's cute, Liam, but I'm already forming my Elite Squad. I've got this game in the bag. Prepare to face the wrath of Team Marcus!
:: Marko : laughing : I can't wait to see Marcus's Elite Squad in action. It's gonna be a hoot! Just make sure you don't trip over your virtual shoelaces, mate.
:: Mike : sarcastically : Oh, great! Another day of watching everyone go nuts over virtual chaos. Count me in, but remember, I have a keen eye for mischief, so play it clean!

>> [1] > 4/4 - Arthur, Nia, Rachel, Liam
:: Arthur : enthusiastic : Nia, have you seen how excited everyone is about the battle royale? This was a fantastic idea! It's going to work wonders for our team-building.
:: Nia : diplomatically : Art, I think it's great to see everyone so engaged, but let's also make sure we don't lose sight of our actual work.
:: Rachel : curious : Art, can you give us some hints about the mystery prize? You wouldn't want me to put my detective skills to work, would you?
:: Liam : playful : Yeah, Art! Throw us a bone here. Is it a vacation? A shiny new coffee machine? Or maybe a year's supply of mayonnaise packets for David?
