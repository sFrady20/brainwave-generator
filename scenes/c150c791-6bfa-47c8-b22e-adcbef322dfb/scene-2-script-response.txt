>> [11] > 3/4 - Liam, Nia, Carmen
:: Liam : ecstatic : Guys, I just thought of the best way to slip up the competition in our battle royale game. Picture this: mayonnaise packets! I mean, who can resist the hilarity of virtual battles with mayo all over the place? People will be slipping and sliding all over the place, and it's just ridiculous enough to be genius!
:: Nia : amused : Liam, you've really outdone yourself with this one. I have to admit, it's a pretty funny idea. But we also need to have a more strategic plan. We can't just rely on mayonnaise packets to carry us to victory.
:: Carmen : laughing : I'm not gonna lie, the thought of turning our virtual battleground into a slippery mayonnaise-fueled mess sounds like a blast. But Nia's right, we'll need more strategy if we want to win this thing.

>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, David
:: Marcus : confident : David, my man! Are you ready to become part of the legendary "Elite Squad"? We're gonna dominate the battle royale with our superior teamwork and cunning tactics. And maybe just a touch of chaotic shenanigans, because life's too short not to have a little fun, right?
:: David : chuckling : Marcus, you always know how to make things more exciting. Count me in for the Elite Squad! I hope you've got some epic plans up your sleeve.

>> [6] > 3/3 - Devika, Rachel, Mike
:: Devika : exasperated : I can't believe people are planning to use mayonnaise packets in the game. This is absolutely ridiculous. Who even came up with this idea?
:: Rachel : grinning : That would be our very own Liam. Honestly, I think it's pretty hilarious. The sheer absurdity of it all will make the game so much more entertaining.
:: Mike : pondering : You know, it might not be such a bad idea. If we're all laughing and having a good time, it might just bring us together more than any normal team-building exercise would.
