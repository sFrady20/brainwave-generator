title: The Singularity Spoof
exposition: Art assigns a group of employees, consisting of Rachel, David, Marcus, and Sam, to plan and throw the company's fictitious "Singularity Day" office party in just one day. Everyone aside from Sam is excited about the idea and brings their wildest thoughts to the table as planning gets underway.

rising action: Through the joint efforts of Rachel, David, Marcus, and Sam, the unusual event takes shape by incorporating dark humor with obscure historical references mocking technological utopia. The buzz around the party raises eyebrows in staff as they walk the tightrope between celebrating the terrifying possibility of a computer uprising and still enjoying creative intrigue.

climax: The party reaches its peak when Liam presents a humorous short video that comically explores scenarios of AI taking over several employees' roles in the company. The video clips get halted midway due to technical glitches which strangely coincides with the printer stopping abruptly as Devika passes by, generating paranoia and eliciting nervously-laughed conspiracy theories.

falling action: As everything gets back to normal and the video clip resumes, team members scramble to suppress suspicions and tighten bonds during this quirky event they all collectively devised. Embracing the nonsensical mess that foreshadows their seemingly far-off demise, they reveal the potentially staged pranks in pockets of conspiratorial conversations.

resolution: The fictitious "Singularity Day" party comes to an end, with many "Wearable Paperweights", tongue-in-cheek awards given out for amusement to lighten the peculiar mood. Yet, no one truly dismisses the outlandish possibility of becoming obsolete making it memorable in the office and the launching pad for chatter relating to turning teammates faint-hearted with future metacreative, wild soirees.```
