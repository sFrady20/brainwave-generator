>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Rachel
:: Marcus : chuckling : You know, Rachel, I found this mildly disturbing but hilarious idea for the Singularity Day party - how about a Morpheus-inspired oracle who tells everyone their techno-doomsday fate?
:: Rachel : grinning : Oh, that's twisted! But I love it! We can have fortunes like, "Beware, you will be replaced by an app!" or, "Your job will be outsourced to an AI-created hologram!"

>> [17] > 2/2 - David, Sam
:: David : excited : Sam, I've got the perfect idea! We can hold an AI-inspired costume contest where everyone dresses up as a glitchy version of their favorite AI character!
:: Sam : sarcastically : That's just great, David, because nothing says "fun" more than dressing up like a malfunctioning machine about to take over the world. Count me in.

>> [20] > 3/6 - Nia, Liam, Carmen
:: Nia : amused : So, Liam, Carmen, have you heard about the Singularity Day party? It seems our coworkers are planning some bizarre activities. I've heard rumors about robot-themed dance-offs and hilariously dark trivia questions!
:: Liam : intrigued : It sounds like a crazy event! I'm always up for something unexpected, especially if it can help us bond as a team while also mocking a possible AI apocalypse.
:: Carmen : giggling : Oh, I can't wait! I'll have to come up with a killer robot-inspired outfit. Maybe some nuts, bolts, and wires hanging off of me, just to keep things edgy!
