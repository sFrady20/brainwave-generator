>> [22] > 3/3 - Art, Rachel, David
:: Art : excited : Alright, folks, listen up! I have a splendid idea for a new and unique office party. Behold, "Singularity Day"! A day to celebrate, or perhaps poke fun at, the possibility of a technological singularity! And guess what? We're going to throw this party TONIGHT! 
:: Rachel : intrigued : Tonight, Art? That's a quick turnaround! But, you know what? Challenge accepted! Let's see how creative we can get on such short notice. What do you think, David?
:: David : chuckling : Well, I'm always up for a good laugh, especially if it involves mocking an apocalyptic event. Count me in!

>> [15] > 4/5 - Rachel, David, Marcus, Sam
:: Rachel : brainstorming : Alright team, we need some wild ideas for this Singularity Day party. The crazier, the better! Let's hear what you've got!
:: David : smirking : How about we create a playlist with some robot-themed songs? You know, like "Mr. Roboto" and "Iron Man"? Oh, and don't forget "Robots" by Flight of the Conchords! Classic!
:: Marcus : laughing : And let's have an AI-themed costume contest! I've always wanted to dress up as HAL 9000, complete with the monotone voice and condescending catchphrases!
:: Sam : unamused : You guys really think this is a good idea? We could be focusing on something more productive... But, if I must participate, I'll make sure everything is organized and runs smoothly.
:: Rachel : excited : Great suggestions! Let's get to work! We have a lot to do and not much time!

>> [11] > 3/4 - Rachel, David, Marcus
:: Rachel : enthusiastic : Okay, we need to spread the word about this party. I'll send out an email and create some flyers. Can you two help me come up with some catchy slogans for "Singularity Day"?
:: David : grinning : "The Singularity is Near, Time to Party like it's the End of the World!" How's that for a start?
:: Marcus : laughing : "Embrace the Chaos: Singularity Day Party, Where Humans Still Rule... For Now!" You know, to remind everyone we're still on top, at least until the machines take over!
:: Rachel : clapping : I love it! Great job, guys. Let's make this the best office party Oddball Industries has ever seen!

>> [20] > 2/6 - Marcus, Sam
:: Marcus : amused : I can't wait for tonight's party, Sam. It's going to be wild! Are you ready to have some fun, or are you just here to make sure we all stay in line?
:: Sam : reluctantly : You know I'm not a fan of this idea, Marcus. But, since I'm involved, I'm going to do my best to ensure things don't get too out of hand. After all, someone has to keep you jokers in check!
