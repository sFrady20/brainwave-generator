>> [20] > 5/6 - Art, Rachel, Marcus, David, Nia
:: Art : chuckling : Well, folks, I'd say this Singularity Day party was a smashing success! Who knew a dystopian theme would bring everyone together like this?
:: Rachel : laughing : Yeah, Art! The way we all worked as a team to make it happen was truly inspiring. Especially the "Wearable Paperweights" awards, nothing like a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor to keep things light!
:: Marcus : grinning : I couldn't agree more, Rachel! We should definitely consider more metacreative, wild soirees in the future. Maybe we should celebrate the Zombie Apocalypse next!
:: David : snickering : Oh, Marcus, that's a fantastic idea! Just imagine all the undead puns we could come up with!
:: Nia : smiling : I must admit, I was skeptical at first, but seeing everyone come together and have a good time made me realize the value in shaking things up a bit. It's been quite the memorable event!

>> [11] > 3/4 - Carmen, Liam, Devika
:: Carmen : excited : Did you guys hear about the next crazy party idea? Zombie Apocalypse! I can already imagine the brainstorming sessions!
:: Liam : smirking : I can't wait to get started, Carmen. It's going to be a wild ride, and who knows, maybe we'll have another legendary glitch moment! 
:: Devika : pondering : You know, these themed parties may just be the catalyst we need to keep ourselves on our toes and prepared for the unexpected. I mean, who would've thought that a printer glitch during a Singularity party would cause such commotion?

>> [18] > 2/3 - Marko, Sam
:: Marko : amused : Zombie Apocalypse, huh? I'm already thinking of all the quirky designs I can create for that one. Say, Sam, any thoughts on what security measures we'll need for a party like that?
:: Sam : deadpan : Marko, we'll make sure to keep the metaphorical zombies from crashing the party...but I have to say, I'm starting to enjoy these bizarre events a bit more now.

== The act concludes with the Singularity Day party coming to an end and everyone involved is extremely satisfied with the unique outcome.
