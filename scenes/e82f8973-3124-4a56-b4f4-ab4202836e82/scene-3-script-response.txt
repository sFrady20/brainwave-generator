>> [15] > 5/5 - Rachel, David, Marcus, Nia, Carmen
:: Rachel : cheerfully : Well, things seem to be getting back to normal, and hey, isn't that what we all wanted from this goofy little party? A dose of ridiculousness and laughter to forget about the frightening possibility of that Singularity thing creeping upon us?
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, I was sweating bullets there for a minute, but it looks like we're all in the clear. Still, that glitch was perfect timing, wasn't it? Almost made you wonder if the robots were watching us...
:: Marcus : smirking : Oh, David, you're just making things worse. But what if I told you that maybe, just maybe, that glitch wasn't completely unintentional? What if someone among us was pulling a little prank of their own, adding fuel to the fire of our collective paranoia?
:: Nia : suspiciously : Marcus, are you suggesting that someone here orchestrated that glitch to heighten the drama? That's quite a theory. But who would be capable and mischievous enough to pull off something like that?
:: Carmen : grinning : You never know, Nia. Oddball Industries has quite the array of sneaky pranksters. Maybe we should just enjoy the remainder of this whimsical and outlandish party without worrying too much about who's pulling the strings.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Liam, Sam, Devika
:: Art : chuckling : I must say, team, this Singularity Day party has turned out to be quite the rollercoaster. I hope it gave everyone a little bit of a jolt, reminding us that sometimes, it's good to cut loose and embrace the nonsensical.
:: Liam : smiling : I'm glad you enjoyed it, Art. It was great seeing everyone laugh and bond over our shared absurdity, even if it was tinged with a hint of fear. I mean, come on! We're Oddball Industries, we're used to striking that balance between the hilarious and the bizarre, right?
:: Sam : sternly : Just as long as we keep our priorities straight and remember that we have a job to do. After all, we can't just spend all our time dreaming up wild parties and pranks.
:: Devika : thoughtfully : True, Sam. But today's little adventure might just give us the motivation to come up with newer and more creative ways to tackle our work challenges. Maybe the Singularity isn't all doom and gloom, after all. It might just be the spark that pushes us to find innovative ways of staying relevant.

== In this act, the team members each do their part to diffuse the tension and suspicions generated by the technical glitches during the Singularity Day party. They engage in light-hearted banter and continue enjoying the nonsensical celebrations, embracing the absurdity of the situation. Both Rachel and Marcus hint that the glitches may have been staged pranks, but no one seems too concerned about finding the culprits. Instead, they focus on strengthening their bonds and appreciating the collective creativity of their oddball family. Devika even suggests that the Singularity might be the catalyst they need to find new ways to stay relevant and tackle their work challenges.
