>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Rachel, Marcus
:: Rachel : excited : Art, did you know that "Doge" is now the hottest meme on the internet? I mean, who knew a Shiba Inu could bring so much joy to our lives?
:: Marcus : amused : Oh, absolutely! And the fact that Doge now has its own cryptocurrency? That's just the cherry on top!
:: Art : confused : Wait.. such meme, very confuse. I remember Doge, but what about other memes? I mean, ain't nobody got time for that, right?
:: Rachel : chuckling : Art, are you trying to be hip with the young crowd? Because, honestly, it's kind of working!
:: Marcus : grinning : Art, look at you, coming up with memes like it's nobody's business! You'll be an internet sensation in no time!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Nia : intrigued : Did you guys hear? Apparently, Art has become a meme lord overnight! I never knew he had it in him.
:: David : laughing : That's hilarious! I can't wait to hear him trying to tell a joke without laughing at his own punchline!
:: Carmen : smirking : Art's meme game may be strong, but I bet it can't beat mine!
:: Liam : boastful : Pfft, please! My meme knowledge is legendary! Art has nothing on me!
>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Devika, Rachel
:: Devika : curious : Art, I heard you've been talking in memes lately. As the queen of scatterbrain, I wholeheartedly approve.
:: Art : struggling : Uh, thanks, Devika. You know, it's all about that "one does not simply" moments, and uhm, "I can haz" brains on internet stuff?
:: Rachel : laughing : Don't worry, Art. As the meme fever grows, you'll surely evolve into a stronger meme master!
>> [11] > 3/4 - Art, Carmen, Liam
:: Art : excitedly : Hey Carmen, Liam, do you know de wae? 'Cause I'm feeling a bit Pepega over here.
:: Carmen : laughing : Art, you've really gone off the deep end with these memes, haven't you? But seriously, can we get back to discussing the quarterly report?
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, Art, we need to focus. This isn't the time to be over 9000 with memes.
:: Art : sheepishly : Sorry folks, I just can't help it. I feel like that one dog in the burning room saying, "This is fine." But let's try to get back on track, shall we?
>> [22] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Nia : concerned : Art, I've noticed that you've been talking in nothing but memes lately. It's becoming a problem, especially during our meetings. We need to figure out how to fix this.
:: Art : desperately : I know, Nia. I've been trying to stop. But it's like my brain has been taken over by the spirit of Harambe. Maybe I'm just living the "cash me outside" life now.
>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Rachel
:: Rachel : confused : Art, I was just talking to Nia, and she mentioned that your meme-talk has become a real issue. Honestly, I have to agree. It's getting harder to understand you, and it's affecting our work.
:: Art : sadly : I hear you, Rachel, but it's like I have this uncontrollable urge to use memes. I guess I'm just a bad luck Brian now. Can you find me a keyboard cat to play me off?
>> [15] > 4/5 - David, Devika, Marcus, Marko
:: David : worried : Guys, Art's meme obsession is getting out of hand! We have to do something about it.
:: Devika : agreeing : Yeah, it's like he's been glitching out or something. It's like that one time I spilled coffee on my keyboard, and it kept typing random emojis for days.
:: Marcus : thoughtfully : Maybe we need to stage an intervention. You know, sit him down and explain how his meme references are affecting the workplace.
:: Marko : confidently : I can help! I've got some experience with interventions, although they usually involve much fewer memes.
>> [16] > 4/7 - Art, Nia, Liam, David
:: Art : gesturing : Ladies and gentlemen of Oddball Industries, I have a groundbreaking idea that I'm going to present to you in the most lit way possible. Here it goes: It's time to take this company to the moon, my fellow apes!
:: Nia : translating : Art wants to share a new idea with us that could take the company to new heights.
:: Liam : confused : Is he actually talking in memes? I thought I heard him say something earlier, but I wasn't sure if I was imagining things.
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, he's really committed to this meme thing. It's like a meme-pocalypse.
:: Nia : focused : Let's try to stay on topic, guys. Art's got important things to share. Art, please continue.
:: Art : excited : So, here's the tea, Oddballers. We gotta start investing in these digital currencies, like Dogecoin. But first, we must find a way to harness the power of the almighty Shiba Inu. They will guide us in the stonk market! To the moon!
:: Nia : translating : Art suggests that we should consider investing in cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, and that we need to develop a strategy for navigating the market.
:: David : laughing : I can't believe he's actually talking like this. It's wild!
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, but Nia's translating skills are pretty impressive too.
:: Nia : serious : We need to remain focused. Art, anything else you'd like to share?
:: Art : nodding : Yes, Nia! We must also yeet all the outdated technology in our office and replace it with more sus systems. Trust me, it's gonna be lit, fam!
:: Nia : translating : Art wants us to replace our outdated technology with more efficient and modern systems.
:: Liam : entertained : This is the most fun I've had in a meeting in a long time.
:: David : grinning : Agreed. This almost makes me want to learn more about memes!
:: Nia : stern : Alright, let's wrap it up. Thanks for your time, everyone.
>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Art : excited : So, I just received that fax from the client, and it's time to give them the 411. Yeet! Send 'em to the moon with our out-of-the-box strategies, fam!
:: Nia : confused : Art, I think we need to focus on the task at hand and ensure our client understands the value we can bring to their business. Can we please communicate in a clear and professional manner?
:: Liam : smirking : Honestly, Art, I didn't think it was possible, but you just leveled up in the meme game. 
>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Marcus, Rachel, Carmen
:: David : worried : Guys, Art's meme obsession is causing real problems now. He nearly messed up that client meeting.
:: Marcus : chuckling : I know, it's like a never-ending meme tornado in there. Good thing Nia could handle the situation.
:: Rachel : concerned : As funny as it is, we really need to find a way to help Art snap out of it.
:: Carmen : grinning : Why don't we stage an intervention, meme-style? Fight fire with fire!
>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Marcus
:: Nia : hesitant : I'm not sure if that's the best idea. Art is obviously struggling, and I don't want to make things worse.
:: Carmen : encouraging : Come on, Nia! It's the perfect way to make Art realize how ridiculous he's being. We could create a meme-filled presentation as a last-ditch effort to snap him out of it.
:: Marcus : agreeing : I'm with Carmen on this one. It's worth a shot, and it could be a lot of fun too.
>> [19] > 3/3 - Nia, Art, Rachel
:: Nia : determined : Art, we need to talk. Your meme obsession is starting to affect our work, and we need to address the situation.
:: Art : confused : What do you mean? I'm just trying to keep it lit, fam!
:: Rachel : serious : Art, we've prepared something to help you understand the impact you're having on the team. Please, just hear us out.
>> [16] > 7/7 - Nia, Art, David, Marcus, Carmen, Liam, Rachel
:: Nia : focused : We've put together this presentation to show you how your meme obsession is affecting the team and our clients. Please pay close attention.
:: David, Marcus, Carmen, Liam, and Rachel : in unison : MEME-TERVENTION!
:: Art : shocked : Woah, I didn't realize it was this bad. I guess I really did go off the deep end with all those memes. I'll try to tone it down, guys. Thanks for helping me see the light.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Liam : amused : So, in light of Art's recent meme overdose, I think it's safe to say we should refrain from discussing internet trends around him.
:: David : nodding : Yeah, I second that. We can still enjoy them, but let's make sure Art's out of the loop. 
:: Carmen : smirking : Can't believe he went full meme-mode on us. I almost thought we'd never get him back to normal!
:: Rachel : chuckling : Agreed! But hey, that meme-tervention really did the trick. You gotta admit, it was a pretty creative solution.
>> [15] > 3/5 - Nia, Marcus, Devika
:: Nia : seriously : So, to keep the office meme-free, at least in Art's presence, I propose we start a nightly email thread where we can share the latest trends. Remember, it's our responsibility to keep things professional during work hours.
:: Marcus : grinning : A nightly meme-ail? Count me in, Nia! But, just to be clear, no mention of the "cat controller" in Art's presence, right?
:: Devika : laughing : That's right, Marcus! We'll have our fun outside of Art's radar. The best of both worlds!
>> [2] > 2/2 - Michael, Samantha
:: Michael : chuckling : Man, can you believe Art's meme obsession? I never thought I'd see the day when our CEO would be spouting internet lingo like a teenager.
:: Samantha : smirking : Yeah, it was definitely a sight to behold. Though, from now on, we should probably limit our meme exposure to that nightly email thread.
>> [18] > 3/3 - Marko, Rachel, Devika
:: Marko : smiling : That meme-tervention was a stroke of genius. Art's back to normal, and we still get to enjoy our meme-sharing sessions.
:: Rachel : nodding : It's a win-win situation. The office will be a more peaceful place for Art, and we still get to have our laughs.
:: Devika : grinning : Agreed! Let's just make sure we abide by our new mantra: "Let's keep it lit, but without including the cat controller, fam!"
