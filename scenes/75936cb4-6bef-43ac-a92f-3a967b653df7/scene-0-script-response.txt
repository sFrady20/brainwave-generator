>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Devika, Rachel
:: Devika : curious : Art, I heard you've been talking in memes lately. As the queen of scatterbrain, I wholeheartedly approve.
:: Art : struggling : Uh, thanks, Devika. You know, it's all about that "one does not simply" moments, and uhm, "I can haz" brains on internet stuff?
:: Rachel : laughing : Don't worry, Art. As the meme fever grows, you'll surely evolve into a stronger meme master!
== In this act, Art falls asleep during a conversation about memes and wakes up with an uncanny ability to reference memes in every sentence, leaving his employees amused and slightly confused. His staff initially finds it endearing, but the meme references escalate as Art struggles to communicate effectively with his team.
