>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Liam : amused : So, in light of Art's recent meme overdose, I think it's safe to say we should refrain from discussing internet trends around him.
:: David : nodding : Yeah, I second that. We can still enjoy them, but let's make sure Art's out of the loop. 
:: Carmen : smirking : Can't believe he went full meme-mode on us. I almost thought we'd never get him back to normal!
:: Rachel : chuckling : Agreed! But hey, that meme-tervention really did the trick. You gotta admit, it was a pretty creative solution.

>> [15] > 3/5 - Nia, Marcus, Devika
:: Nia : seriously : So, to keep the office meme-free, at least in Art's presence, I propose we start a nightly email thread where we can share the latest trends. Remember, it's our responsibility to keep things professional during work hours.
:: Marcus : grinning : A nightly meme-ail? Count me in, Nia! But, just to be clear, no mention of the "cat controller" in Art's presence, right?
:: Devika : laughing : That's right, Marcus! We'll have our fun outside of Art's radar. The best of both worlds!

>> [2] > 2/2 - Michael, Samantha
:: Michael : chuckling : Man, can you believe Art's meme obsession? I never thought I'd see the day when our CEO would be spouting internet lingo like a teenager.
:: Samantha : smirking : Yeah, it was definitely a sight to behold. Though, from now on, we should probably limit our meme exposure to that nightly email thread.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Marko, Rachel, Devika
:: Marko : smiling : That meme-tervention was a stroke of genius. Art's back to normal, and we still get to enjoy our meme-sharing sessions.
:: Rachel : nodding : It's a win-win situation. The office will be a more peaceful place for Art, and we still get to have our laughs.
:: Devika : grinning : Agreed! Let's just make sure we abide by our new mantra: "Let's keep it lit, but without including the cat controller, fam!"
