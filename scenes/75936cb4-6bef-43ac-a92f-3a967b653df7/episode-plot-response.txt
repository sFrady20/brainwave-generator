title: The Meme-pocalypse
exposition: Art Beecham, CEO of Oddball Industries, accidentally falls asleep during a casual conversation where the topic is internet memes, and subconsciously absorbs every meme they discussed. When he wakes up, every sentence he can manage to string together now contains instances and references to extremely popular memes. His staff believes he might be "hip and cool" at first.

rising action: As the meme references escalate further into his communication (sentences are only formed with meme phrases), Art's language confusion leads him deeper down the internet meme rabbit hole, causing unintentional chaos around the workplace. The employees' fascination turns to panic as their communication with Art is near impossible.

climax: During an important presentation, Nia Jones has to act as Art's translator while utilizing her vast knowledge of Internet culture to understand him. Art delivers crucial direction for crucial company directives, and Nia has to decode the unusual meme talk to determine exactly what he wants the team to do.

falling action: After giving critical company directives sharply in meme talk causes great concern, Art's eccentric Internet lingo aggravates a key client. Distressed and just like that Art snapped out of it, and finally drops the meme obsession just enough to diffuse the situation.

resolution: Employees come together and decide not to discuss internet phenomena in Art's presence ever again to preserve sanity in their workplace. A nightly email circulating the latest popular trends continues amongst the workers but always with one mantra attributed to Art: "Let's keep it lit, but without including the cat controller, fam."
