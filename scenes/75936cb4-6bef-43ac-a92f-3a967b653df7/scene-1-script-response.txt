>> [11] > 3/4 - Art, Carmen, Liam
:: Art : excitedly : Hey Carmen, Liam, do you know de wae? 'Cause I'm feeling a bit Pepega over here.
:: Carmen : laughing : Art, you've really gone off the deep end with these memes, haven't you? But seriously, can we get back to discussing the quarterly report?
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, Art, we need to focus. This isn't the time to be over 9000 with memes.
:: Art : sheepishly : Sorry folks, I just can't help it. I feel like that one dog in the burning room saying, "This is fine." But let's try to get back on track, shall we?

>> [22] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Nia : concerned : Art, I've noticed that you've been talking in nothing but memes lately. It's becoming a problem, especially during our meetings. We need to figure out how to fix this.
:: Art : desperately : I know, Nia. I've been trying to stop. But it's like my brain has been taken over by the spirit of Harambe. Maybe I'm just living the "cash me outside" life now.

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Rachel
:: Rachel : confused : Art, I was just talking to Nia, and she mentioned that your meme-talk has become a real issue. Honestly, I have to agree. It's getting harder to understand you, and it's affecting our work.
:: Art : sadly : I hear you, Rachel, but it's like I have this uncontrollable urge to use memes. I guess I'm just a bad luck Brian now. Can you find me a keyboard cat to play me off?

>> [15] > 4/5 - David, Devika, Marcus, Marko
:: David : worried : Guys, Art's meme obsession is getting out of hand! We have to do something about it.
:: Devika : agreeing : Yeah, it's like he's been glitching out or something. It's like that one time I spilled coffee on my keyboard, and it kept typing random emojis for days.
:: Marcus : thoughtfully : Maybe we need to stage an intervention. You know, sit him down and explain how his meme references are affecting the workplace.
:: Marko : confidently : I can help! I've got some experience with interventions, although they usually involve much fewer memes.
