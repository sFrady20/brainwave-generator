:: Nia : confused : Art, I think we need to focus on the task at hand and ensure our client understands the value we can bring to their business. Can we please communicate in a clear and professional manner?
:: Liam : smirking : Honestly, Art, I didn't think it was possible, but you just leveled up in the meme game.

>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Marcus
:: Nia : hesitant : I'm not sure if that's the best idea. Art is obviously struggling, and I don't want to make things worse.
:: Carmen : encouraging : Come on, Nia! It's the perfect way to make Art realize how ridiculous he's being. We could create a meme-filled presentation as a last-ditch effort to snap him out of it.
:: Marcus : agreeing : I'm with Carmen on this one. It's worth a shot, and it could be a lot of fun too.
