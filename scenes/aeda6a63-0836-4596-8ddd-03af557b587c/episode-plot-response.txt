title: K-Pop Conundrum
exposition: Oddball Industries staff learns that internationally famous K-Pop star, Kim Tae-yoon, from the chart-topping group “BTS,” is taking a break from performing and is coming to their town for vacation incognito. Many employees in the office are fans of BTS and start hunting for clues to try to find out if he's already visited the workspace, which sparks excitement and hype.

rising action: Rachel, the receptionist who knows little about K-Pop culture, becomes increasingly overwhelmed as workplace productivity declines, and her coworkers dig up absurd justifications for Kim Tae-yoon's visit. Meanwhile, Nia is the only one in the office secretly immune to BTS's charms; to avoid a break in group-morale and becoming ostracized, she consistently raises non-committal K-Pop trivia questions.

climax: Art Beecham believes he's discovered a crucial clue: Kim Tae-yoon allegedly uses the same coffee cup brand as them. The situation spirals out into hysteria as the crew concocts outlandish theories to stack up imaginary celebrity encounters, each more humorous in nature than the prior, desperately impressing on Nia to be the tie-breaking detective vote.

falling action: The frenzy isolates Nia, pushing her far beyond the threshold. That's when she grabs center-stage by crafting an absurd rollercoaster of coincidences, ultimately weaving a ludicrous narrative of her own in revelation - professing what everyone wants to hear. In response to her masterful fabrication, characters express their awe at her creative exploration of Kim Tae-yoon lore.

resolution: Despite admitting to her peers that she is indeed not a "True Blood BTS fan", Nia becomes respected for respecting the camaraderie in their well-intentioned lightheaded jest. Reeling back from the expedition, Rachel now involves herself with satire entertainment, deliberately quoting old-aged K-Pop lunacy trends amusing the cast; a new pinnacle to Oddball's happy hour comedy unravels.
