>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Nia, Liam, David
:: Art : excited : You won't believe what I've found, everyone! It turns out that Kim Tae-yoon uses the same brand of coffee cups as we do here in the office! Isn't that something?
:: Liam : giddy : Crikey! That's bloody amazing, Art! We must be hot on the trail! I bet he's been hovering around the building, sippin' on his coffee, and we haven't even noticed.
:: David : giggling : So you're saying, he could have come in for a sneaky coffee refill and left us none the wiser? Man, that's as slick as a greased-up slide!
:: Nia : feigning enthusiasm : That's certainly... interesting. I wonder how we could use this information to our advantage? Any ideas, team?

>> [2] > 2/2 - Marcus, Carmen
:: Marcus : animated : Carmen, have you heard? Art discovered that our K-Pop sensation Kim Tae-yoon uses the same coffee cups as we do! Oddballs Industries must hold some hidden charm!
:: Carmen : amused : Oh, Marcus, that's wild! But it's also so random! If only we could use this fact to somehow track him down or lure him into our office. I bet he'd love an Oddball coffee!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Liam, David, Rachel
:: Art : enthusiastic : Gather around, folks! I think we need to start brainstorming how we can use this coffee cup clue to our advantage! The K-Pop gods must be smiling down on us for giving us this opportunity.
:: Liam : confidently : Right, so here's what we do. We set up a coffee cup shrine right by the entrance, and when Kim Tae-yoon sees it, he'll know that this is a place of true coffee cup connoisseurs and just waltz right in!
:: David : chiming in : Or, we could all casually stand around, sipping from our coffee cups, and when he passes by, he'll be so impressed by our refined tastes that he'll want to join our secret society of coffee cup enthusiasts!
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Or, we could just try to get our jobs done instead of obsessing over a guy's coffee cup preference, but hey, what do I know? I'm just the receptionist.
:: Nia : diplomatically : Rachel does have a point, although I must admit, the coffee cup connection is quite intriguing. But let's try to keep our focus on, well, our actual work.

== In this act, Art reveals that he has discovered Kim Tae-yoon uses the same brand of coffee cups as the office, sparking a frenzy of wild theories and outlandish plans to bring the K-Pop star to their workplace. Nia remains level-headed, attempting to bring the focus back to work, but is drawn into the conversation more and more, as her coworkers continue to rely on her for the tie-breaking detective vote. All characters become increasingly cartoonish, with edgy and irreverent humor underscoring their antics. The conversations drift off-topic, emphasizing their absurdity, with Nia doing her best to balance her enthusiasm with professionalism.
