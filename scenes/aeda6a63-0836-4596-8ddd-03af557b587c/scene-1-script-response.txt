>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, Liam, Carmen
:: Rachel : frustrated : You know, it's really hard to get any work done with all this K-Pop madness going on around here. I don't even understand what's so great about this Kim Tae-yoon guy.
:: Liam : exaggerated : Oh Rachel, you just don't get it. Kim Tae-yoon has the voice of an angel and the dance moves of a Greek god! His stage presence is simply mesmerizing... It's like trying to explain the taste of chocolate.
:: Carmen : enthusiastically : Exactly, Liam! And the fact that he might be in our town, even at this very office, is just mind-blowing! I mean, what if he used the same restroom as me? Or used the same stapler?
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Wow, those are some life-changing experiences right there.

>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, David
:: Nia : unsure : So, David, I heard you're quite the BTS fan as well. I've been trying to get into it, but I'm not sure where to start. Any suggestions?
:: David : laughing : Oh, you're asking the wrong guy, Nia. I don't know much about them. I tried listening to their music once, but I couldn't help but giggle at the fact that their band name sounds like an abbreviation for a sandwich with bacon, tomato, and shrimp. 

>> [11] > 3/4 - Marcus, Devika, Marko
:: Marcus : dramatically : I've heard that Kim Tae-yoon is not only a musical genius, but he's also a master of disguise. He could be hiding in plain sight, like a ninja.
:: Devika : excitedly : I know, right?! I heard he once went to a fan meet-and-greet dressed as his own bodyguard! Nobody even knew it was him until he started singing!
:: Marko : chuckling : Mate, if he's half as good at hiding as he is at avoiding paparazzi, we'll never find him. But imagine if he were here, just hanging out with us... "Hey Kim, pass the stapler, mate!"

>> [18] > 2/3 - Nia, Carmen
:: Nia : pretending : So, Carmen, I came across this interesting piece of K-Pop trivia the other day. Did you know that some fans believe Kim Tae-yoon's favorite food is pizza with pineapple and anchovies?
:: Carmen : cringing : Seriously? Ugh, that sounds disgusting! But you know what? If Kim Tae-yoon loves it, I might just have to give it a try.

== In this act, Rachel becomes overwhelmed by the K-Pop enthusiasm that has taken over the office, while Nia tries to fit in by raising non-committal K-Pop trivia questions. The scenes are filled with absurd justifications for Kim Tae-yoon's visit, as well as edgy and irreverent banter as the characters revel in the excitement of the possibility of the K-Pop star being present in their town.
