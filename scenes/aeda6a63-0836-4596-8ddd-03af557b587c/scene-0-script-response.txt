>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, David, Marcus, Carmen
:: Liam : excited : Guys, have you heard the news? Kim Tae-yoon from BTS is in town, incognito! He's on a break from performing, and rumor has it he's just lurking around. Can you imagine if he's already visited the office, and we didn't even know it? 
:: David : laughing : Oh man, that would be wild! I'm a huge fan of BTS, but to be honest, I don't think I'd even recognize him if he was standing right in front of me. I mean, they all look so different in real life, don't they?
:: Marcus : grinning : Oh, David, your naivety is both endearing and hilarious. Of course, they look different, but that's part of the charm, isn't it? It's like a real-life game of "Where's Waldo?" but with K-Pop stars. Let's put our heads together and try to figure out if he's been here, I'm sure there must be some clues lying around!
:: Carmen : chuckling : This is like some wild goose chase, isn't it? I bet he's been in and out of the office, and we're none the wiser. Hey, maybe he's the one who's been rearranging the pens in the supply closet... you know, to throw us off track!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Rachel, Devika
:: Art : pondering : You know, Kim Tae-Yoon might have stopped by my office when I was taking one of my naps. He could've signed a contract, and I'd be none the wiser! Maybe we should check the security camera footage. 
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, because a K-Pop star would totally want to come and sign contracts at our office during his vacation, right? I mean, I get that we're all excited, but let's not lose our grip on reality here, people.
:: Devika : daydreaming : But imagine if Kim Tae-yoon did come here? I bet he left some sort of coded message or a secret signal, like a trail of breadcrumbs for his fans to follow. I mean, that's totally something he would do, right?

>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Marko
:: Nia : trying to play it cool : So, I've heard about this whole BTS K-Pop sensation. Is there something I'm missing, or are people just really into their music? I mean, it's not like I'm against it or anything, but I don't quite understand the hype.
:: Marko : grinning : Oh, Nia, once you experience the magic that is BTS, there's no going back. You might as well give it a try and join us in our fandom frenzy. But beware, you'll probably never be able to listen to anything else again!
