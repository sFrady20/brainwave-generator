>> [21] > 2/2 - Nia, Mike
:: Nia : frustrated : You know what, Mike? I've had enough of this K-Pop mania. Let me put an end to all of this with the ultimate Kim Tae-yoon story.
:: Mike : curious : Really, Nia? Oh, you've got to tell us! I'm all ears.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, David, Carmen
:: Nia : dramatic : Alright, picture this. Kim Tae-yoon, in a moment of pure artistic inspiration, decides to come to our town. Now, what better place to hide than right here in Oddball Industries, right in front of our eyes!
:: David : excited : You don't mean...!
:: Nia : nodding : Yes, David. I mean that throughout the day, Kim Tae-yoon has been disguising himself as various office supplies, sitting on our desks, observing our work, absorbing our creative energy to fuel his next big hit!
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh my god, Nia! You're a genius. So what you're saying is, he could be that stapler on my desk right now?!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, Marcus
:: Nia : grinning : Exactly, Carmen. Or perhaps, he's the mouse that Rachel's been using all day, his soul trapped inside the electronic device, silently judging your internet browsing habits.
:: Rachel : gasping : Oh, I knew there was something off about that mouse today! It felt like it was staring into my soul.
:: Marcus : chuckling : And here I was, thinking my paperclip chain seemed a bit too... rhythmic. So it could've been Kim Tae-yoon all along!

>> [19] > 2/3 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : smirking : Indeed, Marcus. And Art, that coffee cup clue you discovered? Turns out, it's a part of Kim Tae-yoon's master plan. He specifically chose our brand of cups to leave a breadcrumb trail for us to follow, knowing we'd be the only ones clever enough to decipher it.
:: Art : astonished : By golly, Nia! You've managed to unravel the greatest Kim Tae-yoon mystery of all time. This will go down in Oddball Industries history!
