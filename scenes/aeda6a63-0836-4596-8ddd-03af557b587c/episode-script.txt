>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, David, Marcus, Carmen
:: Liam : excited : Guys, have you heard the news? Kim Tae-yoon from BTS is in town, incognito! He's on a break from performing, and rumor has it he's just lurking around. Can you imagine if he's already visited the office, and we didn't even know it? 
:: David : laughing : Oh man, that would be wild! I'm a huge fan of BTS, but to be honest, I don't think I'd even recognize him if he was standing right in front of me. I mean, they all look so different in real life, don't they?
:: Marcus : grinning : Oh, David, your naivety is both endearing and hilarious. Of course, they look different, but that's part of the charm, isn't it? It's like a real-life game of "Where's Waldo?" but with K-Pop stars. Let's put our heads together and try to figure out if he's been here, I'm sure there must be some clues lying around!
:: Carmen : chuckling : This is like some wild goose chase, isn't it? I bet he's been in and out of the office, and we're none the wiser. Hey, maybe he's the one who's been rearranging the pens in the supply closet... you know, to throw us off track!
>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Rachel, Devika
:: Art : pondering : You know, Kim Tae-Yoon might have stopped by my office when I was taking one of my naps. He could've signed a contract, and I'd be none the wiser! Maybe we should check the security camera footage. 
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh, because a K-Pop star would totally want to come and sign contracts at our office during his vacation, right? I mean, I get that we're all excited, but let's not lose our grip on reality here, people.
:: Devika : daydreaming : But imagine if Kim Tae-yoon did come here? I bet he left some sort of coded message or a secret signal, like a trail of breadcrumbs for his fans to follow. I mean, that's totally something he would do, right?
>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Marko
:: Nia : trying to play it cool : So, I've heard about this whole BTS K-Pop sensation. Is there something I'm missing, or are people just really into their music? I mean, it's not like I'm against it or anything, but I don't quite understand the hype.
:: Marko : grinning : Oh, Nia, once you experience the magic that is BTS, there's no going back. You might as well give it a try and join us in our fandom frenzy. But beware, you'll probably never be able to listen to anything else again!
>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, Liam, Carmen
:: Rachel : frustrated : You know, it's really hard to get any work done with all this K-Pop madness going on around here. I don't even understand what's so great about this Kim Tae-yoon guy.
:: Liam : exaggerated : Oh Rachel, you just don't get it. Kim Tae-yoon has the voice of an angel and the dance moves of a Greek god! His stage presence is simply mesmerizing... It's like trying to explain the taste of chocolate.
:: Carmen : enthusiastically : Exactly, Liam! And the fact that he might be in our town, even at this very office, is just mind-blowing! I mean, what if he used the same restroom as me? Or used the same stapler?
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Wow, those are some life-changing experiences right there.
>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, David
:: Nia : unsure : So, David, I heard you're quite the BTS fan as well. I've been trying to get into it, but I'm not sure where to start. Any suggestions?
:: David : laughing : Oh, you're asking the wrong guy, Nia. I don't know much about them. I tried listening to their music once, but I couldn't help but giggle at the fact that their band name sounds like an abbreviation for a sandwich with bacon, tomato, and shrimp. 
>> [11] > 3/4 - Marcus, Devika, Marko
:: Marcus : dramatically : I've heard that Kim Tae-yoon is not only a musical genius, but he's also a master of disguise. He could be hiding in plain sight, like a ninja.
:: Devika : excitedly : I know, right?! I heard he once went to a fan meet-and-greet dressed as his own bodyguard! Nobody even knew it was him until he started singing!
:: Marko : chuckling : Mate, if he's half as good at hiding as he is at avoiding paparazzi, we'll never find him. But imagine if he were here, just hanging out with us... "Hey Kim, pass the stapler, mate!"
>> [18] > 2/3 - Nia, Carmen
:: Nia : pretending : So, Carmen, I came across this interesting piece of K-Pop trivia the other day. Did you know that some fans believe Kim Tae-yoon's favorite food is pizza with pineapple and anchovies?
:: Carmen : cringing : Seriously? Ugh, that sounds disgusting! But you know what? If Kim Tae-yoon loves it, I might just have to give it a try.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Nia, Liam, David
:: Art : excited : You won't believe what I've found, everyone! It turns out that Kim Tae-yoon uses the same brand of coffee cups as we do here in the office! Isn't that something?
:: Liam : giddy : Crikey! That's bloody amazing, Art! We must be hot on the trail! I bet he's been hovering around the building, sippin' on his coffee, and we haven't even noticed.
:: David : giggling : So you're saying, he could have come in for a sneaky coffee refill and left us none the wiser? Man, that's as slick as a greased-up slide!
:: Nia : feigning enthusiasm : That's certainly... interesting. I wonder how we could use this information to our advantage? Any ideas, team?
>> [2] > 2/2 - Marcus, Carmen
:: Marcus : animated : Carmen, have you heard? Art discovered that our K-Pop sensation Kim Tae-yoon uses the same coffee cups as we do! Oddballs Industries must hold some hidden charm!
:: Carmen : amused : Oh, Marcus, that's wild! But it's also so random! If only we could use this fact to somehow track him down or lure him into our office. I bet he'd love an Oddball coffee!
>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Liam, David, Rachel
:: Art : enthusiastic : Gather around, folks! I think we need to start brainstorming how we can use this coffee cup clue to our advantage! The K-Pop gods must be smiling down on us for giving us this opportunity.
:: Liam : confidently : Right, so here's what we do. We set up a coffee cup shrine right by the entrance, and when Kim Tae-yoon sees it, he'll know that this is a place of true coffee cup connoisseurs and just waltz right in!
:: David : chiming in : Or, we could all casually stand around, sipping from our coffee cups, and when he passes by, he'll be so impressed by our refined tastes that he'll want to join our secret society of coffee cup enthusiasts!
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Or, we could just try to get our jobs done instead of obsessing over a guy's coffee cup preference, but hey, what do I know? I'm just the receptionist.
:: Nia : diplomatically : Rachel does have a point, although I must admit, the coffee cup connection is quite intriguing. But let's try to keep our focus on, well, our actual work.
>> [21] > 2/2 - Nia, Mike
:: Nia : frustrated : You know what, Mike? I've had enough of this K-Pop mania. Let me put an end to all of this with the ultimate Kim Tae-yoon story.
:: Mike : curious : Really, Nia? Oh, you've got to tell us! I'm all ears.
>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, David, Carmen
:: Nia : dramatic : Alright, picture this. Kim Tae-yoon, in a moment of pure artistic inspiration, decides to come to our town. Now, what better place to hide than right here in Oddball Industries, right in front of our eyes!
:: David : excited : You don't mean...!
:: Nia : nodding : Yes, David. I mean that throughout the day, Kim Tae-yoon has been disguising himself as various office supplies, sitting on our desks, observing our work, absorbing our creative energy to fuel his next big hit!
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh my god, Nia! You're a genius. So what you're saying is, he could be that stapler on my desk right now?!
>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, Marcus
:: Nia : grinning : Exactly, Carmen. Or perhaps, he's the mouse that Rachel's been using all day, his soul trapped inside the electronic device, silently judging your internet browsing habits.
:: Rachel : gasping : Oh, I knew there was something off about that mouse today! It felt like it was staring into my soul.
:: Marcus : chuckling : And here I was, thinking my paperclip chain seemed a bit too... rhythmic. So it could've been Kim Tae-yoon all along!
>> [19] > 2/3 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : smirking : Indeed, Marcus. And Art, that coffee cup clue you discovered? Turns out, it's a part of Kim Tae-yoon's master plan. He specifically chose our brand of cups to leave a breadcrumb trail for us to follow, knowing we'd be the only ones clever enough to decipher it.
:: Art : astonished : By golly, Nia! You've managed to unravel the greatest Kim Tae-yoon mystery of all time. This will go down in Oddball Industries history!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Marcus, Rachel, Art
:: Nia : relieved : Well, that was an interesting detour into the world of K-Pop lore. I guess I can now add "expert jest/storyteller" to my resume! But in all seriousness, it was great to see everyone bonding and finding humor in our outrageous theories.
:: Marcus : amused : Indeed, Nia! Your storytelling skills have reached legendary heights, and we shall never forget the great K-Pop lunacy that took over Oddball Industries!
:: Rachel : excited : You know, I've been thinking of how we can sustain this newfound source of entertainment. What if we just start quoting old K-Pop trends and adding our own twist to them? It'll be like our little inside joke – a fresh spin on Oddball's happy hour comedy.
:: Art : chuckling : I'm all for it, Rachel! This place could use a bit of fun to lighten the mood. Count me in as a contributor to the ever-growing lunacy!
>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Rachel
:: Nia : smirking : So, I hear that Kim Tae-yoon is actually an undercover agent working for a secret organization of K-Pop stars. They use their fame to travel the world and stop evil supervillains in their tracks. How's that for a conspiracy theory?
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, that’s a good one, Nia! And you know what's even crazier? Turns out those flashy outfits are actually high-tech armor, and their dance moves double as combat training!
:: Rachel : grinning : Brilliant! Let's just say that their synchronized dancing is actually a secret language used for coordinating undercover missions. We've stumbled upon the world's most fashionable and well-choreographed secret agents!
>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, David
:: Devika : sarcastically : Did you guys hear the one about the K-Pop star who's actually an alien from outer space? The reason they have such amazing stamina and dance skills is because they harness the energy of the stars. Pretty far out, right?
:: David : excited : Oh, that's a fantastic one! And you know, their music is actually a secret code to communicate with their home planet. We're just jamming to their otherworldly messages without even realizing it!
>> [20] > 3/3 - Liam, Marcus, Art
:: Liam : grinning : So, here's my contribution to the K-Pop madness: They're actually all robots - perfectly engineered for maximum dance efficiency and vocal range. And we all thought technology was only about smartphones and the internet!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh, Liam! That's a classic one! But here's the real twist: They're not just regular robots, they're time-traveling robots sent from the future to save humanity from an impending disaster - one catchy beat at a time!
:: Art : impressed : I must admit, you guys are getting really creative with these theories. Let's keep the spirit of Oddball Industries alive with laughter and lightheartedness! After all, what's life without a bit of fun and the occasional bout of lunacy?
