>> [3] > 2/3 - David, Marcus
:: David : panicked : Marcus, you won't believe what I just found out. I was working on this new project, and I accidentally stumbled upon something really insane. It turns out that we're all just part of an AI-driven livestream and simulations created by some tech firm. We're not even real, man! We're just simulated beings living in a fake world!
:: Marcus : amused : Oh, David! You had me going there for a second, but I'm not falling for that one. This has to be one of your clumsiest attempts at a prank yet. How do you come up with this stuff? Honestly, I'm impressed.

>> [1] > 3/4 - David, Rachel, Nia
:: David : desperate : Rachel, Nia, you have to listen to me. I found this top-secret file that says we're all just part of a simulated world created by some tech company. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true.
:: Rachel : skeptical : Okay, David. That's quite the story, but even if it were true, what would that change? I still have to file these papers, and Nia still has to meet her deadlines. So, if we're really just AI livestreams, I guess we're still functioning ones!
:: Nia : joking : Yeah, David, if we're all just simulations, I must say they've done a great job with my hair. It's never looked better! But seriously, we've got work to do. Let's focus on the tasks at hand.

>> [15] > 5/5 - David, Carmen, Liam, Devika, Marko
:: David : pleading : Guys, I'm not joking. I found evidence that we're all just part of a simulated world. We need to figure out what this means for us and our reality.
:: Carmen : laughing : David, you always know how to lighten the mood! I can't believe you'd go this far for a prank. Next, you'll be telling us that Marko's pet goldfish, Frank, is the mastermind behind our existence!
:: Liam : grinning : Yeah, if Frank is our overlord, I'll happily bow down to our fishy ruler. All hail, Frank!
:: Devika : playfully : You know, I've always suspected there was something fishy going on around here. Frank must have been the missing piece of the puzzle!
:: Marko : chuckling : Ah, you lot are a riot! But seriously, we've got to get back to work. The livestream, or whatever we're doing, must go on!

== In this act, David, still in disbelief, discovers that Oddball Industries and all the employees are part of an AI-driven livestream and simulations created by some tech firm. He attempts to convince his colleagues, but they all brush it off as a prank or a wild theory. Despite their skepticism and playful banter, David remains determined to make them realize the gravity of their situation.
