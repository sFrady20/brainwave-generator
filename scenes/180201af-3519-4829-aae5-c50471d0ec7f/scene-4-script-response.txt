>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Rachel, Devika
:: David : mockingly : So, uh, guys, since we're just AIs and all, does anyone feel less... I don't know, real? Maybe we should start acting like those glitchy video game characters, huh?
:: Rachel : chuckling : Oh yeah, David, let's just start moonwalking through the office and see if we can find any hidden Easter eggs or cheat codes!
:: Devika : playfully : Why not? We could also try defying gravity and see if we can find the edge of this simulated world! Maybe we'll stumble upon the programmers' secret lair!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Carmen, Liam, Nia
:: Marcus : dramatically : Fellow Oddballs, we have been enlightened! We must embrace our newfound understanding and venture forth into the unknown realms of our simulated existence!
:: Carmen : smirking : Couldn't agree more, Marcus. Let's see how many outfit changes we can do in a day, or maybe we can attempt to break the office record for most coffee consumed in an hour!
:: Liam : laughing : Or better yet, let's all swap job roles for a day and see if the simulation can keep up!
:: Nia : sarcastically : Oh, wonderful ideas, everyone. But how about we maintain a semblance of professionalism and remember that we still have a business to run here?

>> [20] > 3/3 - Art, Sam, Marko
:: Art : yawning : Did someone say something about professionalism? I must have dozed off for a moment. Anyway, I think I'll take a nap on this here pool table. Nothing more professional than a CEO who knows how to relax, am I right?
:: Sam : deadpan : You're definitely setting new standards, Art. Maybe I should start napping on the job too, just to fit in.
:: Marko : jokingly : Yeah, Sam, maybe you'll finally get some rest and stop saving the world from imaginary cat villains in your downtime!
