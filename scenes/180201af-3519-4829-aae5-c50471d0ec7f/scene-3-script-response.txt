>> [15] > 3/5 - Marcus, Liam, Sam
:: Marcus : excited : Liam, Sam, my dear friends! I've just had the most life-changing epiphany! We are all part of a livestream - our very existence is inside this simulated reality! So, why not celebrate the absurdity of life by doing things we'd never usually do?
:: Liam : chuckling : Marcus, you never cease to amaze me with your wacky ideas. And you know what? I'm in! What do you have in mind?
:: Marcus : enthused : Wonderful! I say we create an impromptu musical number filled with bizarre lyrics and backflips! Just imagine it, all of us embracing the lunacy of our simulated existence!

:: David : intrigued : Did I just hear "musical number"? Count me in too! I'm never one to back down from immortalizing my clumsiness for the world to see.
:: Sam : smirking : You know what? I'm usually all serious, but the idea of letting loose is oddly tempting. You're right, Marcus. We're living in a simulation, so why not conquer my fear of cats by pretending I'm a feline superhero?
