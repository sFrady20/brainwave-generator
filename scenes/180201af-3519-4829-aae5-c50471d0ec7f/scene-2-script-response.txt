>> [4] > 3/3 - Carmen, Devika, Rachel
:: Carmen : enthusiastically : You know, it's kind of liberating knowing we're just artificial beings! We can totally do the craziest things and get away with it!
:: Devika : laughing : Yeah, I mean we could just freak out the so-called "users" watching us and start doing the wildest things imaginable!
:: Rachel : smirking : Let's do it! Let's show them we won't be bound by societal norms, even in this simulated world! What's the most outrageous idea you can come up with?

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Carmen, Devika
:: Carmen : grinning : How about we dress Marko up as me and have him impersonate a user inside our AI environment? That'll surely stir things up!
:: Devika : giggling : Oh, that's brilliant! Marko, are you in for this wild ride?
:: Marko : excitedly : You bet I am, mates! Let's ruffle some digital feathers and see how far we can take this!

>> [10] > 2/3 - Marko, Carmen
:: Carmen : proudly : Behold, the new and improved Carmen, a.k.a. Marko! Now let's see you pretend to be a user in our simulated reality!
:: Marko : imitating Carmen : Oh, darling, I was born to be you! Let's show these users what we're made of – quite literally!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Marko, Rachel, Devika
:: Marko : flamboyantly : Good day, ladies! It's me, the fabulous Carmen! I'm here to shake things up and give these users a show they'll never forget!
:: Rachel : laughing : You're doing great, Marko! Your impersonation is spot on, and I bet the users are having a field day watching this!
:: Devika : amused : I can only imagine the comments and reactions we're getting from this bizarre performance! Keep it up, Marko! You're a natural at being Carmen.

== In this act, the Oddball Industries employees embrace their simulated reality and begin to disrupt the normal office workflow with eccentric and bizarre actions. Carmen, Devika, and Rachel discuss defending their artificial world against the norm and enlist Marko's help. They dress him up as Carmen and have him impersonate a user inside their AI environment. As Marko goes around the office in character, his coworkers enjoy the absurdity of the situation and find humor in their new approach to their simulated lives.
