title: Simulated Shenanigans
exposition: David is working on a new project in his cubicle when he accidentally taps into a top-secret file concerning him and his coworkers. He discovers that Oddball Industries and all the employees are actually part of an AI-driven livestream and simulations created by some tech firm. Shocked and confused David decides to confront his coworkers and slowly unveil the odd truth about being mere sims in a livestream.

rising action: As each member of the Oddball Industries team begins to understand the revelation, they are faced with an existential crisis. They start to question the point of living and the realness of everything around them. Their quest for dissecting reality bizarrely abates their fears as they conceive pushing the limits of their simulated world.

climax: With a newfound acceptance of their life as simulated beings, the employees decide to test their new knowledge and make the most unique choices they could think of, creating viral-causing laughs through eccentric and bizarre actions that disrupt the normal office workflow. Carmen is chatting in the women's bathroom with Devika and Rachel when they hysterically defend the artificial world against fabricated society's norm. They enlist the help of Marko in finding remarkable yet strange ways to push boundaries by dressing him up as Carmen and impersonating a user inside their AI environment.

falling action: Each endeavor growing wilder, Marcus starts an impromptu musical number composed of bizarre lyrics and backflips for the simple enjoyment of it. Samantha kicks her humor meter up a notch, randomly doing cartwheels and pretending she was a feline superhero for conquering her fear of cats. Losing their inhibitions, the livestream rating spirals into comedic gold fuelled with strange, unexpected escapades.

resolution: In the end, the Oddball Industries team realizes they have brought more levity and laughter to their reality than ever, as even within a simulation, happiness and excitement are possible. Upscaling their approach towards living around the simple idea that even in artificial worlds, it is still about making the most of life without focusing on the preachy aspect or lecture around it. They learned to let fate be and now unite more in meaningful moments and foster cosines before the big times slowly fade back-to-work, all within the shots composed realm.
