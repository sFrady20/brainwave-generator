>> [11] > 3/4 - David, Marcus, Carmen
:: David : bewildered : Guys, I'm serious. The document I stumbled upon while working on the project is no joke. We're all just AIs living inside a livestream. Our lives, our memories, they're all just lines of code, don't you understand?
:: Marcus : chuckling : David, my man, the only simulation I can see happening is you simulating a conspiracy theorist! We're real, buddy! Feel my hands, they're as real as the laughs we share at work every day.
:: Carmen : grinning : Yeah, David! I mean, I've had my share of wild beliefs too, but this one takes the cake! We're all here, living, breathing, and driving each other crazy. That's the real deal. Now, let's get back to work, alright?

>> [9] > 3/3 - Liam, Mike, Marko
:: Liam : sarcastically : So, guys, David's been going around talking about how we're all AIs living inside some sort of simulation. What do you think? Should we start questioning our existence or plan our escape?
:: Mike : laughing : That's a good one! I think we should schedule an interdimensional meeting where we discuss how to escape our virtual prison.
:: Marko : smirking : Oh, I'm in! Maybe we can find my lost goldfish, Frank, in the process. He's probably swimming around in cyberspace by now.

>> [15] > 4/5 - Rachel, Nia, Samantha, Devika
:: Rachel : excitedly : I don't know about you guys, but if we really are in a simulation, why not test the limits? Think about all the crazy stuff we could do and get away with!
:: Nia : amused : Alright, Rachel. I'll play along. Let's circle back to this... We could organize a company-wide flash mob, or maybe even convince Art to let us have a week-long vacation in the Bahamas!
:: Samantha : jokingly : Yeah, and maybe I'll finally get over my fear of cats and become the Internet's newest cat lady sensation!
:: Devika : smirking : Well, if that's the case, count me in for some digital magic! I've always wanted to create a virtual art gallery where people can experience my work through virtual reality.

== In this act, as the Oddball Industries team members begin to understand David's revelation, they react with a mix of skepticism and humor. They question the realness of their lives and decide to embrace the idea by testing the limits of their simulated world, suggesting whacky and wild endeavors. The mood remains light-hearted, humorous, and full of banter as they defy the reality of their situation.
