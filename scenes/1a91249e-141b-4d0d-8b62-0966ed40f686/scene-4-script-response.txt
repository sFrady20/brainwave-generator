>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : chuckling : Who would've thought that our chaotic little workplace would attract the interest of big-time investors like these eccentric billionaires? I mean, they seem to genuinely appreciate our, uh...innovative environment.
:: Nia : amused : Yeah, Art, it's pretty wild. I never thought that my special brownies, plus our team's loopy ideas, would be the recipe for Oddball's success. It's like we woke up in an alternate universe where common sense and logic got thrown out of the window.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Rachel, Marcus, David
:: Liam : excited : Did you hear that, guys? The billionaires are investing in us! We're officially a cutting-edge innovation incubator now!
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Oh great, just what we need, more pressure to be innovative. I wonder if they'll provide us with a constant supply of Nia's brownies to keep us on our creative toes.
:: Marcus : laughing : Well, if they do, we'll certainly have some interesting office dynamics! Can you imagine an entire workday with everyone in the state we were in today? That'd be a sitcom all on its own!
:: David : grinning : I can see it now: "The Loopy Lunch Bunch: Adventures in Corporate Chaos!" We'd be a hit for sure.

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Devika
:: Nia : concerned : Devika, I know we're all having a laugh, but remember, now we have a big responsibility to come up with game-changing ideas since they're investing in us as an innovation incubator. You're our lead developer, so we'll need your A-game to stay on track.
:: Devika : reassuring : Don't worry, Nia. As soon as the brownie effect wears off, I'll be back to my normal, innovative self. I promise I won't let you or the company down.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Carmen, Marko, Mike, Sam
:: Art : addressing the team : Listen up, everyone! I know today has been a rollercoaster of bizarre events, but at the end of the day, we've come out on top. I want to thank you all for your incredible adaptability and for making an impression on our eccentric visitors.
:: Carmen : cheerful : Well, Art, we couldn't have done it without the brownie boost! But in all seriousness, it just goes to show that Oddball Industries really is a one-of-a-kind place.
:: Marko : smirking : True, I don't think any other company could turn a loopy lunch into a lucrative investment opportunity. We're living proof that there's method in our madness!
:: Mike : chuckling : Yeah, and who knows? Maybe we're setting a new trend for the future of corporate innovation. Loopy Lunches for everyone!
:: Sam : deadpan : As long as I don't have to deal with any cat-related incidents, I'm all for it.
