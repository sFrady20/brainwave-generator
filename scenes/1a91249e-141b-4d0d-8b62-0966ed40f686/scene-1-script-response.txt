>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Art : alarmed : Nia, I've got to admit, the employees are acting quite... peculiar after eating those brownies. This might not be the best time to host a group of potential investors. What are we going to do?
:: Nia : concerned : I know, Art. I didn't expect this to happen. We need to think on our feet and manage the situation as best we can.

:: Marcus : dramatically : Has anyone considered that we might be living in a simulation right now? Can you imagine our alternate-reality selves laughing at our current predicament?
:: Carmen : giggling : Marcus, that's ridiculous... but hilarious! If we're in a simulation, can you just imagine how the real world version of this office must be?

:: David : hiccuping : Guys, I can't stop hiccuping, it's like a permanent "hiccup mode." It's like the brownies released some sort of hiccup demon inside me!
:: Marcus : grinning : Beware, the hiccup demon is on the loose, and it's contagious! Prepare for the end of the world, one hiccup at a time!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Devika, Rachel
:: Liam : smirking : You know, if reality is an illusion, maybe we can manipulate it to our advantage. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a billionaire in their own alternate reality?
:: Devika : pondering : Or maybe we're all just characters in some animated show, and right now, we're being watched by thousands of people!
:: Rachel : amused : Well, if that's the case, then we'd better give them a good show, right? Alternate reality show, here we come!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : determined : Okay, team, we need to find a way to pull ourselves together and impress these investors. Any ideas?
:: Nia : strategic : Let's use the chaos to our advantage. We can say it's a new approach to team building and creativity. Eccentric people love eccentric things, after all.
:: Marcus : excited : And we could perform an improvised musical number in front of them! Think about it, singing and dancing to our hearts' content, making everything up as we go along!
