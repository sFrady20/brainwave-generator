>> [11] > 3/4 - Art, Nia, Rachel
:: Art : baffled : I thought the brownies would bring some cheer, but these folks are acting like they've lost their marbles!
:: Nia : worried : It wasn't my intention for things to get so out of hand! Maybe I should've just stuck with my usual non-baked motivational speeches. I hope this doesn't jeopardize our chances with the investors.
:: Rachel : grinning : Don't worry too much, Nia. These billionaires might appreciate a little quirky creativity. It's not your everyday office tour, that's for sure!

>> [8] > 2/3 - Marko, David
:: Marko : excitedly : Have you ever noticed how shrimp are like the ocean's popcorn, mate? They're just small, bite-sized, and ridiculously delicious. I could go for some shrimp popcorn right now.
:: David : chuckling : Mate, that's a hilarious comparison! Now, I'll never be able to look at shrimp the same way again. But honestly, is it the brownies talking, or do we genuinely need to invest in shrimp popcorn?

>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Liam
:: Marcus : philosophically : Liam, do you ever wonder if we're just cogs in a larger machine, being driven by the whims of cosmic forces beyond our control? I mean, today's just further proof, isn't it?
:: Liam : animatedly : Marcus, my man, I've had similar thoughts! And if that's true, then we might as well make the most of it and go along for the ride, right? What's life without a little unpredictability?

>> [4] > 2/3 - Carmen, Devika
:: Carmen : giddily : Devika, can you imagine how perfectly an office karaoke night would boost our synergy levels? We could belt out show tunes and really get to know each other's deepest, darkest secrets.
:: Devika : dreamily : Oh, absolutely! And we could have a pet day too, where everyone brings their furry or scaly friends to the office. Just imagine all the possibilities for collaboration and inspiration!

== In this act, the employees at Oddball Industries are affected by Nia's brownies, causing them to act strangely and engage in offbeat, whimsical conversations. Art, Nia, and Rachel acknowledge the bizarre scenario, hoping it might somehow appeal to the eccentric billionaire investors visiting the office.
