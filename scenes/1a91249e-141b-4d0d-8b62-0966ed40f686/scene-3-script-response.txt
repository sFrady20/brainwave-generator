>> [16] > 3/7 - Arthur, Nia, Liam
:: Arthur : chuckling : Well, folks! If our oddball antics haven't scared off these billionaires yet, I say we play to our strengths! Let's take our craziest ideas and see if we can't win them over with our unique brand of innovation!
:: Nia : amused : You're right, Art! We're Oddball Industries - this is what we do! Alright, team, let's embrace the madness and pitch them some ideas that'll blow their minds!
:: Liam : excited : Alright, guys! What if we made an app that combines the best features of all social media platforms, but every time you post something, it has to be in the form of a haiku? Users would have to get creative!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Devika, Marcus, David
:: Rachel : laughing : How about we develop a new type of keyboard, but instead of regular keys, it has tiny trampolines for your fingers? Typing would turn into a full-body workout!
:: Devika : grinning : And what if we designed a new computer mouse that looks and feels like a real mouse? It would certainly give "scrolling" a whole new meaning!
:: Marcus : enthusiatic : Oh! Oh! A cloud storage service, but instead of uploading files, you upload memories, and they're automatically tagged by mood and location! Who needs photo albums when you can have a "trip down memory lane" button?
:: David : chuckling : How about a productivity tool that analyzes your work habits and only allows you to access certain websites when you've completed specific tasks? We'll call it... "Workaholics Anonymous"!

>> [16] > 4/7 - Arthur, Nia, Liam, Carmen
:: Arthur : impressed : These ideas are wild, but they're uniquely Oddball Industries! Keep them coming, everyone!
:: Nia : nodding : I must say, I never expected our team to have so much enthusiasm in pitching these insane ideas.
:: Liam : grinning : We're just getting started! We've got a whole treasure trove of absurdity waiting for our billionaires!
:: Carmen : smirking : You know what they say, "When life gives you loopy brownies, make lemonade!"...Wait, did I mix that up?
