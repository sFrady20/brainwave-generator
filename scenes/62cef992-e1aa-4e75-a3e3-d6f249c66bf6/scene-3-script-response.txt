:: Marcus : excitedly : Can you believe it, folks? Our little joke may come back to bite us, as Beyoncé herself is actually on her way here! I, for one, am both excited and terrified.
:: Liam : nervously : Oh man, we need to clean up our act and quick! I don't want her to think we're some kind of ungrateful bunch of lunatics.
:: David : panicking : Me neither! We went a little overboard with the memes and jokes, and now we have to undo it all before she arrives!
:: Carmen : anxiously : Alright, let's split up and start taking down all the ridiculous stuff we put up. We need to turn this office back into a professional workspace, stat!
