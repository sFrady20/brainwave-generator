>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Liam, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : chuckling : So we're doing this, huh? Turning Oddball Industries into the world's most eccentric Beyoncé fan club?
:: Liam : smirking : You bet your sweet Nigerian ass we are, Marcus! We're going all out, meme-style, baby! 
:: David : excited : I've been practicing my Single Ladies dance for years, lads! Can't wait to finally put it to use!
:: Carmen : laughing : Look, as much as I'd love to see David bust a move, I can't believe we're about to memeify Beyoncé and turn this office into a circus. 

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Rachel, Devika
:: Marko : grinning : Alright, team! Let's brainstorm some hilariously bizarre Beyoncé-related desktop backgrounds. I'm talking Sasha Fierce meets Oddball Industries, maybe with a sprinkle of obscure Beehive references.
:: Rachel : amused : I can picture it now, Marko. A giant cartoon bee twerking to "Crazy in Love," with Art wearing a shirt that says "Queen B's #1 Fan"!
:: Devika : giggling : And how about we edit some photos of Nia with song lyrics around her like, "I'm a grown woman, I can do whatever I want!"?

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Sam, Mike, Liam
:: Art : confused : I don't quite understand why we're doing all of this, but if it boosts morale and brings us closer as a team, I'm all for it! 
:: Nia : uncertain : I mean, I'm all for some Bey-inspired fun, but let's not forget we still have a software company to run here, people.
:: Sam : sarcastically : Oh, come on, Nia. What's life without a little bit of Beyoncé-themed chaos in the workplace?
:: Mike : chuckling : I second that, Sam! It's like a dream come true for me. I've always wanted to see Art channel his inner Queen B.
:: Liam : mischievously : Trust me, folks. Once this is all over, we'll have a good laugh at ourselves and get back to business as usual. But for now, let the memes commence!

>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, Carmen
:: Nia : sighing : Alright, I guess there's a certain charm in embracing the madness. Just make sure we don't lose sight of our actual goals here.
:: Rachel : smirking : Have a little faith, Nia! We'll ride the Beyoncé wave, create some legendary office memes, and then get back to being Oddball Industries.
:: Carmen : excited : Yeah! It's not every day we get to pull off something this ridiculous. Plus, I really want to see Art don a Beyoncé wig.
