>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Rachel
:: Marcus : chuckling : So, Beyoncé's coming to our little software company, huh? Whoever thought this day would come! I wonder if she's here to fix some bugs and optimize our code?
:: David : sarcastically : Yeah, I heard she's an expert in C++ and loves nothing more than a good debugging session. What do you think, Rachel?
:: Rachel : rolling her eyes : Oh, you guys are hilarious. I'm not the biggest fan, but it's still a big deal that she's coming here! Maybe she's just trying to see how us mere mortals live, you know?
:: David : grinning : Oh, we're mere mortals now? Well, if that's the case, do you think she'll use her magical goddess powers to boost our office productivity?

>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, Carmen
:: Liam : overacting : So, Carmen, have you heard the latest rumor? Our office will be graced by the divine presence of Queen Bey herself! I'm sure it has nothing to do with the recent coverage of our software glitches, right?
:: Carmen : smirking : Oh, absolutely not! I mean, who doesn't want a little Beyoncé in their life? If anything, her visit will be the perfect distraction from all these boring processes and meetings.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Art, Devika
:: Nia : concerned : It's all fun and games until our office becomes an internet joke. We need to stay focused on our work, not on Beyoncé's visit. What if she's here to discuss a partnership or something serious? We can't afford to lose our credibility.
:: Art : carelessly : Oh, Nia, always the worrywart! This visit could be a blessing in disguise! Maybe Beyoncé's here to learn how to create her own software empire. Who knows, we could end up with a whole new line of Beyoncé-branded apps!
:: Devika : laughing : Oh, that would be hilarious! A whole suite of apps for all things Beyoncé. From a workout app to a fashion app, the possibilities are endless!

>> [7] > 2/2 - Marko, Samantha
:: Marko : raising an eyebrow : So, Sam, any thoughts on why Beyoncé is visiting our office? I mean, it's not every day that a pop superstar comes to a place like ours.
:: Samantha : deadpan : Maybe she's secretly a talented coder and wants to join our team. Or maybe she's here to help us improve our security measures. Who knows? I just hope she doesn't bring a cat with her.
