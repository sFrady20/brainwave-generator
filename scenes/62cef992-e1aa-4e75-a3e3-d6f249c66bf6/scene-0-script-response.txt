>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Art, Liam, David
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, you won't believe this! I just got an email from Beyoncé's management saying she's going to make a surprise visit to our office as part of some corporate initiative! We're going to have a Q and A session, a dance party, and a motivational talk from Queen B herself!
:: Art : bewildered : Beyoncé? Coming to Oddball Industries? Are you sure it's not a prank? I mean, what would a world-famous celebrity want to do at a humble software company like ours?
:: Liam : sarcastically : Maybe she's looking for a new career as a software developer? I heard she's quite the coding prodigy. But for real, this is totally bonkers! I can't wait to see her in person!
:: David : chuckling : Or maybe she's just a big fan of our office memes! You know, Beyoncé's totally into absurd internet humor. Can you imagine her cracking up at our twisted jokes?

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Carmen, Devika, Samantha
:: Marcus : ecstatic : Have you all heard the news? Beyoncé's visiting our office! I can't even begin to imagine what sort of chaotic, over-the-top hilarity her visit might bring!
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, just imagine the kind of memes we can create with her in the background! It's going to be internet gold!
:: Devika : intrigued : I wonder if she knows anything about software development? Maybe she's secretly a tech genius in disguise.
:: Samantha : rolling eyes : I don't know about that, but I sure hope she doesn't bring a cat along. If she does, I'm hiding in the bathroom during her visit.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Nia, Michael, Marko, Rachel, Liam
:: Nia : smirking : Alright, everyone. Let's reel it in. I know we're all excited about Beyoncé's visit, but let's not get too carried away with our weird conspiracy theories and office gossip. We need to be professional and represent Oddball Industries in the best light.
:: Michael : grinning : You're right, Nia. We can't afford to look like a bunch of crazed stans during her visit. We need to stay focused and make sure we're ready for her surprise appearance.
:: Marko : chuckling : But can you imagine how viral our office would go if Beyoncé actually participated in our bizarre shenanigans? 
:: Rachel : grinning : Yeah, we'd be internet legends overnight! Maybe she'll even join us for a future prank or two.
