>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Art : firmly : Attention, everyone! There's been an unprecedented amount of chaos today due to those bizarre memes. So, consider this a company-wide ban on visiting suspicious websites during work hours! I don't want to see this happen again.
:: Nia : stern : Art is right. We learned firsthand about the dangers of unverified internet content, so let's not make the same mistake twice. Focus on the work and leave the memes at home.
:: Liam : chuckling : I guess we won't be trading those rare Pepes anymore, huh? Ah well, back to the grindstone.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Rachel : playfully : Hey, you guys heard about the new rule, right? Art really put his foot down on meme-sharing. I guess we'll have to go back to our normal office gossip and banter, won't we?
:: David : grinning : Indeed, Rachel. But hey, did you hear the one about the guy who walks into a bar and orders a meme? Oops, I guess I can't share that one anymore! *laughs at his own joke*
:: Carmen : smirking : Oh David, your jokes are like the internet itself - full of unexpected twists and turns. But seriously, I think we're all better off without those mind-altering images. I'll stick to my coffee-fueled escapades, thank you very much.
:: Marcus : reminiscing : Ah, the memes may have been a wild ride, but it's time we get back to our usual Oddball antics. However, I must admit, I'll miss the irrational laughter and absurd theories they spawned. Farewell, dank memes, farewell.
>> [20] > 2/2 - Devika, Marko
:: Devika : relieved : So Marko, it's finally over. We've managed to delete all the memes and block any further tampering. I can't believe we survived the Memetics Incident!
:: Marko : lighthearted : Yeah, it's been quite a trip, mate! Now that we're back to reality, let's celebrate with some good ol' Australian vegemite on toast. No more meme-induced paranoia, just the satisfaction of a job well done.
>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, Liam, Carmen
:: Rachel : cheekily : So, Liam, Carmen, now that we're officially meme-free, I can't help but share one last conspiracy theory. What if the memes were actually created by an alien race to study our behavior? *laughs*
:: Liam : amused : Oh, Rachel, I admire your creativity, but I think we've had enough memes and conspiracy theories for one day!
:: Carmen : laughing : Yeah, let's just leave the aliens out of this one. We've all learned our lesson and it's time to focus on the work at hand. But hey, if we ever need a good laugh, we can always count on David's terrible puns!
