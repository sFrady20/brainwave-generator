:: Art : distracted : Nia, have you seen this meme of an alien in a tinfoil hat? It's hilarious! It really makes you wonder what they're trying to tell us. I mean, am I right?

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Devika
:: Nia : serious : Devika, I need your help. I suspect something is off with these memes; they're causing strange behavior. Can you take a look at the files and see if anything has been tampered with?
:: Devika : intrigued : Sure thing, Nia. Let me see what I can find. I've always been suspicious of cat memes. They seem too innocent. What if they're actually a secret way to control our minds?! Oops, sorry, got carried away there. I'll check the files now.

>> [8] > 2/3 - Nia, Marko
:: Nia : determined : Marko, I need your help. Devika's looking into the files, but I need you to help me analyze the memes and see if there's anything harmful that could be causing all this odd behavior.
:: Marko : amused : You mean how David can't stop dancing, and Carmen's speaking gibberish? That's bonkers, mate! But sure thing, I'll have a look, Nia. Let's unravel this meme mystery together.

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Devika
:: Devika : concerned : Nia, I checked the files and you were right. They've been tampered with. It's like someone added a subliminal layer to these memes, causing everyone to act strangely.
:: Nia : horrified : It's worse than I thought. We need to come up with a plan to stop this madness and protect the company from further chaos.

>> [8] > 2/3 - Nia, Marko
:: Nia : urgently : Marko, listen, Devika found out the meme files have been tampered with. We need to stop everyone from sharing or seeing these memes. Can you help me block them, so we can contain this problem?
:: Marko : determined : You got it, Nia. I'll start working on a filter to block these mind-altering memes from reaching our staff. It's time to say goodnight to the bad guys, and by bad guys, I mean whoever's having a laugh at our expense with these twisted memes!
