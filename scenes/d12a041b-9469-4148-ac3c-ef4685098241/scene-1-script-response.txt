>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Art, Carmen, Marcus
:: David : panting : Guys, I just can't stop dancing! It's like those memes have taken over me! HELP!
:: Art : frantically : What if this is all a government conspiracy to control our minds through memes? We have to warn everyone!
:: Carmen : smirking : To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand these memes. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of internet culture, most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.
:: Marcus : chuckling : This is simply one of the most bizarre days of our lives! It's like we've all been infected by some sort of meme virus!

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : paranoid : Nia, we have to do something! The memes are after us! My entire wall is full of Pepe drawings!
:: Nia : concerned : Okay, Art. I've seen enough. We need to put an end to these memes and their effects on our employees.

>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Rachel, Liam
:: David : trying to catch his breath : How much longer do I have to dance like this? I'm starting to get blisters on my feet!
:: Rachel : giggling : David, you're hilarious! But seriously, these memes are driving everyone crazy!
:: Liam : grinning : The power of the internet, my friends! It's both a gift and a curse.

== In this act, the meme phenomenon spirals out of control, with the characters becoming increasingly affected by the memes. Art's conspiracy theories intensify, Carmen's cryptic lingo causes confusion, and David's uncontrollable dancing worsens. Nia decides something must be done and sets out to figure out a solution to the meme madness.
