>> [16] > 7/7 - Nia, Art, Marcus, Liam, Carmen, Devika, Marko
:: Nia : concerned : Listen up, everyone. The office has become a surreal meme-infested madhouse, and we need to come up with a plan to stop it before we all become unrecognizable lunatics. I found out that the meme files have been tampered with. Any ideas on how to tackle this issue and find out who's behind it?
:: Art : dazed : Gee, Nia, if we could only use the power of trollface to track down the evil meme mastermind! I've always said, "if you can't beat 'em, troll 'em!"
:: Marcus : chuckling : Art, my friend, I think you've got it! But perhaps we should leave the meme warfare to the internet experts and focus on protecting Oddball Industries from any further memetic mayhem.
:: Liam : sarcastically : Yeah, we can't allow our office work to devolve into a never-ending parade of "dank memes" taking over our lives. We need a back-to-basics approach before we end up in some sort of meme-spiracy dimension.
:: Carmen : smirking : And don't forget the risk of being lost in translation to meme-speak! I mean, what if one day we just walked in here and everyone was speaking in doge? "Much work. Very office. Wow."
:: Devika : seriously : As hilarious as this is, we should really be focused on finding a solution. I can try to trace the source of the tampered files and block them from our network to prevent further damage. Marko, any ideas for dealing with the existing memes?
:: Marko : nodding : Sure thing, Devika. We could design a simple script that detects and deletes the altered memes from our devices. We'll need everyone to cooperate and submit their devices for a quick meme-cleansing session.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Art, Devika, Marko
:: Nia : determined : Great, let's get started on this plan. Devika and Marko, I'm counting on you two to take the lead on this. Art, try to resist the urge to scribble more memes on your office walls.
:: Art : sheepish : Understood, Nia. No more meme doodling for me. I'll just stick to good old-fashioned daydreaming about peanut butter sandwiches.
:: Devika : focused : I'll begin tracing the source of the tampered files immediately. Marko, once you have the script ready, we can start the meme-cleansing process.
:: Marko : enthusiastic : You got it, Devika! We'll have this office meme-free in no time, and then we can all return to our usual, only slightly less chaotic lives.
