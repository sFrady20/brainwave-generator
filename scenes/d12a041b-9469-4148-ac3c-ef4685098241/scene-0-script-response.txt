>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Liam : exaggerating : Hey, have you guys seen this website full of the dankest memes known to mankind? It's absolutely bonkers, I tell ya!
:: David : awkwardly : Memes? You mean those funny pictures with words on them? I've seen a few, but never gave them much thought. Are they really that entertaining?
:: Carmen : excited : Oh David, you have no idea. They're like a beautiful virus that latches onto your brain and makes you laugh uncontrollably.
:: Rachel : curious : What kind of memes are we talking about here? I mean, I've seen some funny ones before, but nothing that would cause a full-blown office obsession.

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Devika, Nia
:: Marko : chattering : So Nia, I was just telling Devika about this hilarious meme I found. It's like a penguin wearing a suit, and he's saying, "I'm not sure if I'm well-dressed, or I just look like a waiter." I mean, come on, how funny is that?
:: Devika : amused : Oh Marko, that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many more memes out there, each one more absurd than the last.
:: Nia : stern : While I do appreciate a good penguin joke, we need to remember that we're here to work, not browse memes all day.

>> [4] > 3/3 - Rachel, Carmen, Sam
:: Rachel : gossiping : Have you noticed how Art has been acting differently since we all got into memes? He's been going on and on about some secret government project related to memes.
:: Carmen : smirking : Yeah, it's been hilarious watching him come to these crazy conclusions. Well, you know what they say, "You don't just get on the meme train, the meme train gets on you!"
:: Sam : paranoid : Speaking of memes, did you see the one with the cat wearing sunglasses? It freaked me out. I just can't handle cats. They're up to something, I know it!

>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, David
:: Marcus : dramatically : David, my friend, have you ever danced with the memes in the pale moonlight? My entire world has been turned upside down by these captivating images.
:: David : chuckling : You and your theatrics, Marcus! I admit, a few of the memes have made me laugh, but I'm not sure I'd call it life-changing. They're just... silly pictures.
