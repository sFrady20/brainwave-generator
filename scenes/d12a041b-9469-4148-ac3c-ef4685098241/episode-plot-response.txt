title: The Memetics Incident
exposition: The employees of Oddball Industries stumble upon a funky looking website full of so-called "dank memes" while browsing the internet during lunch. The company immediately gets hold of this phenomenon, however, strange occurrences start happening as soon as everyone begins sharing the memes amongst each other.

rising action: The memes quickly become an office obsession, causing bizarre effects on individuals. For example, Art suddenly develops conspiracy theories, Carmen starts spouting cryptic internet lingo only understandable by memes, and David randomly breaks out into uncontrollable awkward dancing.

climax: With everyone being affected by and plunging into chaos, Nia decides to confront Art about the absurd office behavior but finds him furiously scribbling the outlines of the meme characters on his office wall. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Nia discovers that the files of these memes have been tampered with during transmission.

falling action: Nia calls an urgent meeting with the key members of the company to establish a plan of action against the mind-altering website. With input from Marko and Devika, they form and execute a plot which involves deleting the memes while searching for the perpetrators.

resolution: Art, somewhat returned to his normal oafish self, mandates an office-wide ban on visiting suspicious websites. The characters involved learn from their experiences with the troublesome memes, bringing the company slightly closer together. However, despite the resolution, Rachel can't help but sneak in one last conspiratorial meme-related joke before the episode wraps up.
