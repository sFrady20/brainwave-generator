>> [9] > 2/3 - Liam, Marcus
:: Liam : chuckling : So, Marcus, have you heard about Art's bizarre "Oddballology" thing? I can't believe he's gone off the deep end like this.
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh, Liam, you have no idea! This whole conspiracy theory has turned the office into a madhouse! It's like a game of Chinese whispers around here, and I don't even know what the original message was anymore. But, you know, the world is a stage, and we're just the actors. Perhaps, we should just lean in and embrace our roles in this wild, spiraling plot.
:: Liam : grinning : Yeah, you're right. It's kinda like a crazy internet meme, isn't it? The more absurd and ridiculous it gets, the more people want to spread it around.
:: Marcus : nodding : Precisely, my friend! Let's see how far this rabbit hole goes.

:: Carmen : stirring her coffee : Marko, have you heard the latest gossip about Art's "Oddballology" plan? It's spreading like wildfire!
:: Marko : smirking : Oh, Carmen, I can't keep up with all the nonsense. I just overheard someone saying Art is planning to build a bunker under the office to survive the apocalypse! It's like a bad horror movie script!
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : Guys, this is really getting out of hand. We need to find out what Art is actually up to, and put a stop to this ridiculous conspiracy theory. It's distracting everyone from their work.
:: Devika : amused : Well, at least it's entertaining! The office has never been this lively before. And who knows, maybe Art's Oddballology will become the next big internet sensation, and we'll all be famous!
