>> [15] > 3/5 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : confused : What am I even doing with my life? Does Oddball Industries actually mean anything? Is our purpose even real?
:: Nia : concerned : Art, you're starting to sound a bit... existential. What brought this on?
:: Devika : smirking : I think I saw this coming. Art, were you reading that book about existentialism in the break room?
>> [11] > 3/4 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : hesitant : Well, yes, but can you blame me? The world is a confusing place, and sometimes I wonder if we're just tiny cogs spinning in an absurd machine.
:: Nia : amused : Art, this is getting overwhelming. I think you need to take a step back and breathe. This isn't the end of the world.
:: Marcus : chuckling : For once, boss man, I agree with Nia! Life is absurd, but that's what makes it fun. Embrace the chaos, my friend.
>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Liam
:: Art : worried : Liam, I'm having doubts about Oddball Industries. What's our purpose? What if we're just spinning our wheels?
:: Liam : grinning : You know, Art, I've heard that doubt is like a rollercoaster; it's fun to ride, as long as you don't let it derail your train of thought. So, let's just keep the train on the tracks, shall we?
>> [11] > 3/4 - Liam, Marcus, Carmen
:: Liam : overly-excited : Have you guys heard about Art's new challenges for all departments? I mean, I'm all for shaking things up, but this is next-level weird!
:: Marcus : chuckling : My friend, welcome to the world of oddball objectives! It seems like Art has truly embraced his inner madcap genius. I'm not sure what's gotten into him, but I have a feeling we're in for an interesting ride.
:: Carmen : perplexed : I wonder what's behind all this sudden change. Do you think Art stumbled upon some kind of secret revelation, or is he just trying to keep us on our toes?
>> [5] > 2/3 - David, Devika
:: David : nervously-laughing : So, Devika, what do you think about the new goals Art has set for us? I mean, a software that predicts when the end of the world will come? It's pretty out there, even for our office!
:: Devika : thoughtfully : I have to admit, it's an unusual challenge. But you know what? I kind of like it. It's pushing us to think way beyond our usual limits. Who knows, maybe we'll discover something groundbreaking in the process!
>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Rachel
:: Art : determined : Nia, Rachel, listen closely. It's of the utmost importance that we prepare for the unthinkable. I've already laid out my challenges, and I want you both to be the driving forces to make sure all departments achieve these new goals.
:: Nia : hesitantly : Art, we appreciate your enthusiasm for innovation, but don't you think some of these objectives are a bit... unconventional? Wouldn't it be more beneficial to focus our efforts on more realistic targets?
:: Rachel : gossiping : I heard from David that Art has been all over the dark web lately. Maybe he knows something we don't? 
>> [9] > 2/3 - Liam, Marcus
:: Liam : whispering : Marcus, you're not going to believe this. I overheard Rachel talking about Art being on the dark web! Do you think that's what's causing all these bizarre changes around here?
:: Marcus : grinning : My friend, I think you've just stumbled upon the juiciest piece of gossip this office has ever seen! Let's just enjoy the ride and see where this takes us, shall we?
>> [19] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Liam, Carmen, David, Devika
:: Art : excited : Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share the next big thing for Oddball Industries - "Oddballology!" A movement centered around embracing humanity's absurd nature!
:: Nia : skeptical : Art, that sounds... interesting, to say the least. Where did you come up with such an idea?
:: Liam : amused : I, for one, am all ears! If it involves embracing absurdity, count me in.
:: Carmen : curious : Art, this sounds like a wild ride. But are you sure this is the direction we should take the company?
:: David : chuckling : To be honest, it sounds like something straight out of the Twilight Zone, but I'm game!
:: Devika : hesitant : I guess as long as it doesn't interfere with our work, it could be fun. But can you give us more details, Art?
:: Art : enthusiastic : Of course! Oddballology is about questioning conventional norms, diving headfirst into the unknown, and embracing the beautiful chaos of life. It's a journey into uncharted territories, and we'll be the pioneers!
>> [9] > 2/3 - David, Marcus
:: David : laughing : So let me get this straight, Art's got us all wrapped up in this "Oddballology" thing, like we're forming some kind of bizarre cult? This is too rich!
:: Marcus : intrigued : You're not joking? Our fearless leader is genuinely proposing this wild ride? I must say, it's tempting to see where it might lead us all...
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Carmen, Marko
:: Nia : concerned : The more I think about it, the stranger Art's Oddballology idea seems. What if it's a distraction and we end up losing focus on our real goals?
:: Liam : grinning : Come on, Nia! Live a little! We might just find that it's a crazy detour we never knew we needed.
:: Carmen : undecided : I'll admit, a part of me is excited for the adventure. But another part is worried that it could all blow up in our faces.
:: Marko : curious : So what does this Oddballology entail? Are we to abandon our current projects and focus entirely on this new philosophy?
>> [9] > 2/3 - Liam, Marcus
:: Liam : chuckling : So, Marcus, have you heard about Art's bizarre "Oddballology" thing? I can't believe he's gone off the deep end like this.
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh, Liam, you have no idea! This whole conspiracy theory has turned the office into a madhouse! It's like a game of Chinese whispers around here, and I don't even know what the original message was anymore. But, you know, the world is a stage, and we're just the actors. Perhaps, we should just lean in and embrace our roles in this wild, spiraling plot.
:: Liam : grinning : Yeah, you're right. It's kinda like a crazy internet meme, isn't it? The more absurd and ridiculous it gets, the more people want to spread it around.
:: Marcus : nodding : Precisely, my friend! Let's see how far this rabbit hole goes.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Carmen, Marko, Nia, Devika
:: Carmen : stirring her coffee : Marko, have you heard the latest gossip about Art's "Oddballology" plan? It's spreading like wildfire!
:: Marko : smirking : Oh, Carmen, I can't keep up with all the nonsense. I just overheard someone saying Art is planning to build a bunker under the office to survive the apocalypse! It's like a bad horror movie script!
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : Guys, this is really getting out of hand. We need to find out what Art is actually up to, and put a stop to this ridiculous conspiracy theory. It's distracting everyone from their work.
:: Devika : amused : Well, at least it's entertaining! The office has never been this lively before. And who knows, maybe Art's Oddballology will become the next big internet sensation, and we'll all be famous!
>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Nia : concerned : Art, we need to talk about the recent changes you've been implementing across the company. There's a lot of confusion and, frankly, wild conspiracy theories are starting to spread. We need to get to the bottom of this.
:: Art : distressed : Nia, it all started when I stumbled upon this book on existentialism. It left me questioning my purpose in life and whether our company has any real meaning.
:: Liam : smirking : I heard we were preparing for the end of times! That's quite the departure from our usual corporate shenanigans!
>> [18] > 2/3 - Carmen, David
:: Carmen : whispering : So, David accidentally spilled the beans to Marcus about Art's crazy Oddballology idea, and now it's the hottest gossip in the office!
:: David : sheepishly : Yeah, who knew a little slip of the tongue could cause such an office buzz? Let's just hope we can get back to normal soon...
>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Devika, Marcus
:: Nia : assertive : All right, everybody, we need to confront Art and find out what's really going on with this Oddballology business. No more whisper campaigns; we need answers.
:: Devika : amused : Honestly, it's been a wild ride! But you're right, we need to sort this out before the entire office turns into an episode of The Twilight Zone.
:: Marcus : melodramatic : And so begins the final battle between reason and chaos! May the best oddball win!
>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marko
:: Nia : determined : Art, we've gathered everyone here to ask you about the dark web and how it has influenced your recent decisions for the company.
:: Marko : grinning : Yeah, mate, we're all ears! Give us the juicy details and let's make some sense of this wild rollercoaster you've put us on!
:: Art : realizing : My goodness, I didn't mean to toss the whole office into a frenzy. I was trying to explore uncharted territory, but I suppose I got carried away.
