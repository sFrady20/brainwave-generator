:: Marcus : chuckling : My friend, welcome to the world of oddball objectives! It seems like Art has truly embraced his inner madcap genius. I'm not sure what's gotten into him, but I have a feeling we're in for an interesting ride.
:: Carmen : perplexed : I wonder what's behind all this sudden change. Do you think Art stumbled upon some kind of secret revelation, or is he just trying to keep us on our toes?

>> [5] > 2/3 - David, Devika
:: David : nervously-laughing : So, Devika, what do you think about the new goals Art has set for us? I mean, a software that predicts when the end of the world will come? It's pretty out there, even for our office!
:: Devika : thoughtfully : I have to admit, it's an unusual challenge. But you know what? I kind of like it. It's pushing us to think way beyond our usual limits. Who knows, maybe we'll discover something groundbreaking in the process!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Rachel
:: Art : determined : Nia, Rachel, listen closely. It's of the utmost importance that we prepare for the unthinkable. I've already laid out my challenges, and I want you both to be the driving forces to make sure all departments achieve these new goals.
:: Nia : hesitantly : Art, we appreciate your enthusiasm for innovation, but don't you think some of these objectives are a bit... unconventional? Wouldn't it be more beneficial to focus our efforts on more realistic targets?
:: Rachel : gossiping : I heard from David that Art has been all over the dark web lately. Maybe he knows something we don't? 

>> [9] > 2/3 - Liam, Marcus
:: Liam : whispering : Marcus, you're not going to believe this. I overheard Rachel talking about Art being on the dark web! Do you think that's what's causing all these bizarre changes around here?
:: Marcus : grinning : My friend, I think you've just stumbled upon the juiciest piece of gossip this office has ever seen! Let's just enjoy the ride and see where this takes us, shall we?
