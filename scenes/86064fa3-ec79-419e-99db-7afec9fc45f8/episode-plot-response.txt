title: Art's Existential Pickle
exposition: CEO Art Beecham stumbles upon a book about existentialism in the office break room. After skimming a page or two while chowing down donuts, he is suddenly overcome with doubts about his purpose in life and whether or not his company actually means anything.

rising action: A doomsday scare recently surfaced on the dark web, and Art starts tweaking his company towards preparing for end times. However, employees have no idea why Art's behavior has changed, and he challenges all departments to achieve wild, unexpected goals, causing increasing confusion among the staff.

climax: In a whirlwind of existential confusion, Art reveals his plans for "Oddballology," a movement centered around embracing humanity's absurd nature, to a pulled-aside group of staff members, namely Nia, Liam, Carmen, David, and Devika. This concerns the group, and David accidentally reveals Art's pitch in passing while joking to Marcus.

falling action: The news of Art's plan spirals into a ridiculous conspiracy theory, complete with juicy office gossip interwoven by Rachel. Secret conversations about the theory and whispers of the impending doomsday profligate, between Liam and Marcus at the restroom sink and in the lunch kitchen with Carmen and Marko exchanging words while preparing food.

resolution: Nia encounters Art, reigns him in, and confronts him in his office with all staff members present confront him on what he truly saw on the dark web. Art realizes he has influenced his team through their comical, noisy misunderstandings in unnecessary ways tangentially related to his concepts to navigate uncharted territories or ideas. While Oddballology crumbles amid its confusingly whimsical thought forms, everyone in Oddball Industries rejoices; they've bonded through the purported end of times and all share that they've grown alternatively from the growing panic of an existential pickle rescued by company resources, bonding with closing gags centered around breaching odd societal ends hilariously together.
