>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Nia : concerned : Art, we need to talk about the recent changes you've been implementing across the company. There's a lot of confusion and, frankly, wild conspiracy theories are starting to spread. We need to get to the bottom of this.
:: Art : distressed : Nia, it all started when I stumbled upon this book on existentialism. It left me questioning my purpose in life and whether our company has any real meaning.
:: Liam : smirking : I heard we were preparing for the end of times! That's quite the departure from our usual corporate shenanigans!

>> [18] > 2/3 - Carmen, David
:: Carmen : whispering : So, David accidentally spilled the beans to Marcus about Art's crazy Oddballology idea, and now it's the hottest gossip in the office!
:: David : sheepishly : Yeah, who knew a little slip of the tongue could cause such an office buzz? Let's just hope we can get back to normal soon...

>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Devika, Marcus
:: Nia : assertive : All right, everybody, we need to confront Art and find out what's really going on with this Oddballology business. No more whisper campaigns; we need answers.
:: Devika : amused : Honestly, it's been a wild ride! But you're right, we need to sort this out before the entire office turns into an episode of The Twilight Zone.
:: Marcus : melodramatic : And so begins the final battle between reason and chaos! May the best oddball win!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marko
:: Nia : determined : Art, we've gathered everyone here to ask you about the dark web and how it has influenced your recent decisions for the company.
:: Marko : grinning : Yeah, mate, we're all ears! Give us the juicy details and let's make some sense of this wild rollercoaster you've put us on!
:: Art : realizing : My goodness, I didn't mean to toss the whole office into a frenzy. I was trying to explore uncharted territory, but I suppose I got carried away.
