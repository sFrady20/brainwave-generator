>> [15] > 4/5 - Art, Nia, Liam, Marcus
:: Art : chuckling : Well, folks, the great Game of Cubicles was entertaining while it lasted. But, as they say, all good things must come to an end.
:: Nia : agreeing : I think we can all agree that we've gone a little too far with these impersonations. Let's focus on our work and leave the game behind. We've learned our lesson.
:: Liam : smirking : Funny how chaos can sometimes lead to the most unexpected outcomes, huh? Who said chaos isn't a ladder?
:: Marcus : laughing : You've got that right, Liam! The antics were a blast, but I guess it's time to come back down to earth and get our heads back in the game - the real game, work.

>> [20] > 4/6 - David, Carmen, Mike, Rachel
:: David : sheepishly : Hey, guys, sorry if I stirred up some chaos earlier. I was just trying to settle that feud with Devika.
:: Carmen : lighthearted : Well, David, your clumsy attempts did lead to an unintended revelation. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Sometimes, the most surprising things can come out when everyone's a little unhinged.
:: Mike : grinning : Yeah, who would've thought that Carmen and I would end up being the talk of the office? Ah well, life's full of surprises, innit?
:: Rachel : smirking : Well, that revelation sure put the brakes on our Game of Thrones madness. Now we can finally get back to our normal, boring office life.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Marcus, Devika
:: Nia : reflecting : I have to admit, I'll kind of miss the excitement of our little role-playing adventure. But we shouldn't let it consume our work lives.
:: Marcus : sighing : True, Nia. We had our fun, but now it's time to focus on what we're here for - making Oddball Industries the best it can be.
:: Devika : agreeing : You guys are right. It was a fun distraction, but we need to get back on track. Plus, I think we all had enough drama to last us a lifetime!

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Liam
:: Art : proud : Liam, I must say, that whole Game of Cubicles thing really brought out some... interesting sides of our employees. It's good to see everyone letting loose once in a while.
:: Liam : chuckling : Yeah, boss. It was a wild ride while it lasted. But I think we're all ready to get back to business now... at least, until the next office shenanigan.
