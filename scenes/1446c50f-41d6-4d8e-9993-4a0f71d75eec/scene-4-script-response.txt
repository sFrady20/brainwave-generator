>> [20] > 4/6 - Nia, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Nia : chuckling : I must admit, this whole Game of Cubicles escapade has been entertaining, albeit chaotic at times. But, let's agree to leave the GoT impersonations behind and focus on our actual work before Art starts questioning our sanity!
:: David : grinning : Chaos? Who said chaos isn't a ladder? But alright, Nia. We'll tone it down. Though, I must say, I didn't expect to unveil the forbidden love between Carmen and Mic.
:: Carmen : flustered : Hey, I'm as surprised as you are about that whole thing! Let's just put that behind us and get back to our usual quirky selves.
:: Marcus : laughing : Well, my friends, it's been a wild adventure. I'll miss my role as Tyrion, but perhaps it's time to return to the land of the living, away from the realms of dragons and power struggles.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Liam, Rachel, Devika
:: Liam : playful : Rachel, my dear! I hear you've been offering some rather odd pieces of advice to people in your role as the Keeper of the Reception Desk. Care to share any more pearls of wisdom?
:: Rachel : smirking : Oh, Liam, my time as a wise counselor has come to an end. But if you must know, always remember: if you're going to plot world domination, don't leave your plans in the communal fridge! You never know who might come snooping.
:: Devika : amused : Well, I'm glad I got myself a perfectly normal yogurt then. As much as I enjoyed the Game of Cubicles, it's probably for the best that it ended before we all lost our minds entirely.

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Sam
:: Art : content : Those kids really had a ball today, huh Sam? Although, I'm glad they've decided to hang up their GoT hats for now. Couldn't have that chaos going on for too long.
:: Sam : relieved : You said it, boss. We need to maintain some semblance of order around here, or who knows what kind of madness might ensue!

== By the end of the day, the characters recognize that the Game of Cubicles was entertaining but ultimately went too far. They collectively decide to return to their normal work lives and retire their Game of Thrones impersonations, though a few continue to practice "Valar Morghulis" greetings chanting well into the next week, maintaining Oddball Industry's crazy work environment. Art and Sam are relieved to see the madness subside, and everyone enjoys a game of pool at the party room to wrap up the day.
