>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Devika, David, Marko
:: Marcus : theatrically : Friends, co-workers, loyal subjects of Oddball Industries, let me tell you a tale of intrigue, drama, and the most epic of battles. For today, we witness a battle like no other, a choir war song to end all wars!
:: Devika : bemused : A choir war song? Marcus, you do realize we're impersonating Game of Thrones characters, not forming a medieval glee club, right?
:: David : chuckling : You know, I once knew a guy who thought the Battle of the Bastards was going to be an intense showdown between Jon Snow and a herd of Dachshunds. Talk about a misinterpretation of epic proportions.
:: Marko : grinning : Well, I'm always in for an oddball adventure. If Marcus wants a choir war song, let's give him a choir war song. Besides, it's not every day we get to indulge in the chaos that is our bizarre workplace.

>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, Liam, Carmen
:: Rachel : cryptically : Ah, greetings young padawans of the corporate realm. I, Rachel the Oracle, offer you counsel in these trying times of war and impersonations. First, remember that not all dragons breathe fire; some just offer really spicy hot wings. Second, trust not the office printer, for it is the bane of productivity and the harbinger of paper jams. And third, always remember to take your coffee breaks, lest you find yourself lost in the endless stream of emails and tasks, never to return.
:: Liam : amused : Rachel, I am Lord Commander of the Sales Watch, and I shall heed your wise counsel. The hot wings shall fuel my ambitions, and the coffee breaks shall keep my mind sharp for the battles ahead. 
:: Carmen : playfully : Thank you, Rachel the Oracle. I, Lady Carmen Lannister, shall stand tall against the tyranny of printer jams and ensure the smooth workings of our fine kingdom. Onwards, to victory and office supplies!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Art, Sam
:: Nia : dramatically : My loyal followers, today marks a glorious occasion in the history of our fine company. As we weave our intricate web of corporate games, let our impersonations ring true and our laughter fill the halls.
:: Art : drowsily : Indeed, my dear subjects. This day shall be remembered for generations to come as the day we united under the banner of Oddball Industries, embracing the chaos of Westeros and the corporate world in harmony. Valar Morghulis, dear friends.
:: Sam : skeptically : Alright, I'll play along. But if I catch any of you trying to use your newfound "powers" to get out of work, I'll have you escorted off the premises faster than you can say "Hold the door!"

== In this act, Marcus' bizarre idea of recruiting people for a choir war song gains traction among the employees, adding to the ongoing chaos of the Corporate Games Day. Meanwhile, Rachel, fully embracing her new persona, offers strange advice to anyone who approaches the reception desk. Everyone continues to take part in the office shenanigans, trying to outdo each other with their Game of Thrones impersonations and escalating office feuds.
