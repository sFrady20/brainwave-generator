title: Game of Cubicles
exposition: Art initiate a "Corporate Games Day" to encourage team building, everyone decides to impersonate their favorite Game of Thrones character. As the characters go through their day, team allegiances are formed with each person doing their best GoT impression and weaving outlandish interpersonal stories in their roles.

rising action: The impression battles escalate, leading to petty office conflicts and intensified office feuds as everyone is trying to out-game their colleagues. Marc offers inaccurate GoT opinions driving Marcus to recruit people for a bizarre choir war song. Meanwhile, Rachel is filled with odd pieces advice for anyone who approaches the reception desk.

climax: David, in his attempt to resolve a feud with Devika, manages to reveal hidden romantic feelings between Carmen (aka Cersei) and Mic (aka Petyr Baelish) in the lunch kitchen while trying to negotiate a peace settlement. Shock erupts, distracting people from the escalating corporate games.

falling action: Suddenly embracing their real work-life dynamics, the characters tone down their impersonations, agreeing they've gone too far as David dodges all responsibility saying "who said chaos isn’t a ladder?"

resolution: By the end of the day, laughter and sanity prevail around a game of pool at the party room. Everyone gracefully retires their GoT roles acknowleging the entertainment it brought, though a few continue to practice "Valar Morghulis" greetings chanting well into the next week, maintaining Oddball Industry's crazy work environment.
