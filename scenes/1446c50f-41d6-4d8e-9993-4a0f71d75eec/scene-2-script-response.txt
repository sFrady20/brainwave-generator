>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Devika, Carmen, Mike
:: David : sheepish : So, I was thinking, Devika, now that I've got you here, maybe we can just put an end to this feud, huh? I mean, it's just a game after all. We're all still coworkers at the end of the day.
:: Devika : sighing : Fine, David. I agree, we should resolve this. Now's as good a time as any.
:: Carmen : coyly : Well, if we're all settling our differences, I guess there's something I should mention too...
:: Mike : nervously : Yeah, uh, Carmen and I, we kind of have this... thing going on. I mean, it's nothing serious, but... erm...
:: Carmen : blushing : It's true. We've been secretly involved, but we didn't want it to affect our work relationships or the team dynaMikes, so we kept it under wraps.
:: David : shocked : Wait, what? You two are in a secret romance? Wow, I was not expecting that. Talk about plot twists!
:: Devika : amused : Well, that's certainly some unexpected news!
>> [20] > 3/3 - Nia, Marcus, Art
:: Nia : shaking head : I can't believe Carmen and Mike have a secret romance going on! What a day it's been, and it's all thanks to this crazy Corporate Games Day!
:: Marcus : chuckling : I told you, Nia. Chaos is everywhere, and now we have the office's very own Romeo and Juliet to prove it. It's like an unending supply of entertainment.
:: Art : smirking : How about we all agree to wind down a bit, huh? The games have been fun, but we should remember we're still coworkers, not actors in a fantasy world.
>> [15] > 5/5 - Liam, Rachel, Marko, Sam, Devika
:: Liam : grinning : You've got to admit, though, it's been quite an eventful day! I haven't had this much fun at the office in quite some time.
:: Rachel : smirking : Yeah, but we should probably get back to reality soon, shouldn't we? This place is starting to feel like a madhouse.
:: Marko : chuckling : I wouldn't have it any other way, love! That's the charm of Oddball Industries.
:: Sam : reluctantly agreeing : It's been fun, but I guess we should focus on our actual work now.
:: Devika : philosophically : You know, sometimes it takes a little chaos to remind us of the good things we have. Sure, we're an odd bunch, but that's what makes us unique.
