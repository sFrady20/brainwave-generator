>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : stressed : Nia, I can't let anyone see my haircut. It's a disaster! And there's an important business meeting in a couple of days! I need to hide it somehow.
:: Nia : thoughtful : Well, Art, maybe you could wrap your head in a towel and pretend you've caught a cold? You know, so people won't think it's strange that you're all covered up.
:: Art : relieved : Nia, you're a genius! I'll do that. But we have to make sure nobody finds out about my ridiculous haircut.

>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Carmen, David, Liam
:: Rachel : gossiping : Guys, have you seen Art wearing that towel on his head all day? He says it's because he has a cold, but I think there's something more to it.
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, definitely! Maybe he got a terrible haircut and doesn't want anyone to see it!
:: David : chuckling : That would be the worst possible thing to happen right before an important meeting!
:: Liam : scheming : You know what? We should start taking bets on what Art's haircut looks like! I bet it's something absolutely wild!

>> [2] > 2/2 - Marcus, Devika
:: Marcus : laughing : Devika, I've just heard that Liam's organizing an office betting pool on Art's haircut! Can you believe it?!
:: Devika : giggling : Oh my gosh, that's hilarious! I wonder what his hair really looks like under that towel. Maybe it's a reverse mohawk!

>> [5] > 3/3 - Nia, Art, Mike
:: Nia : concerned : Art, this betting pool on your haircut is getting out of hand. Liam's been hyping it up all day, and everyone's curious.
:: Art : panicking : You're right, Nia. But what am I supposed to do? My haircut is a disaster! I need to keep it hidden, but these darn sneezes and coughs are becoming tiresome.
:: Mike : snickering : Boss, I gotta say, your fake sneezes are Oscar-worthy! But seriously, you should probably face the music sooner or later. Your secret won't stay hidden forever.
