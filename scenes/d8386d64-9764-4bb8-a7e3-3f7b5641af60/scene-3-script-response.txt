:: Art : eager : I'm all in, Nia! I've been practicing my dramatic sneezes and coughs to enhance the comedic effect. We can start the presentation with a big sneeze to catch everyone's attention!
:: Rachel : enthusiastic : I'll make some hair-related puns as we discuss our projects, you know, to weave the theme through the entire presentation! Plus, I can spread some rumors about a hair-related tech breakthrough, just to confuse the competition! 
:: David : chuckling : Oh, Rachel, I can already see the headlines: "Oddball Industries Unravels the Secrets of Hair!" But seriously, folks, I'm in! I can prepare a hilarious slideshow with memes and references to famous bad haircuts throughout history. That'll keep the audience entertained!
:: Marcus : excited : I've got it, friends! I'll write a poetic and dramatic manifesto about the importance of embracing imperfections and thinking outside the box. Then, I'll deliver it with gusto and a few tears, just for good measure. Who knows, it might just go viral!
