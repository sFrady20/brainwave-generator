>> [19] > 2/3 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : annoyed : Art, this whole fake cold thing is getting out of hand. Everybody is talking about your mysterious haircut, and Liam even started a betting pool! It's time to face the music and just reveal the catastrophe hidden beneath that towel.
:: Art : nervous : I don't know, Nia. It's pretty bad. I just... I can't let anyone see it. They'll never take me seriously again! But you're right, something's got to give. This has spiraled way out of control.
:: Nia : supportive : Well, like it or not, it's going to come out eventually. We need to find a way to turn this into a positive, perhaps even use it to our advantage during the meeting.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Nia, Art, Liam
:: Liam : smirking : So, I heard you two talking about Art's little secret. I, for one, am dying to see what's under there! The betting pool has the whole office buzzing.
:: Nia : sarcastic : Thanks, Liam. We were just trying to figure out a way to make the big reveal in a way that might benefit us during the meeting.
:: Art : sighing : You're right. Fine, let's just get this over with. 

* Art removes the towel, revealing his disastrous haircut *

:: Liam : shocked : Oh, wow. That's... that's something else, Art.
:: Nia : inspired : You know, we might be able to spin this in our favor. Let's incorporate your haircut into our presentation strategy. We'll show that Oddball Industries isn't afraid to think outside the box, even when it comes to our CEO's hair!
:: Art : reluctant : I suppose it could work. As long as we're all in this together, I'm game.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Nia, Art, Liam, Carmen, Marcus
:: Carmen : laughing : So, we're all going to modify our hair to match Art's? This is gonna be one memorable meeting!
:: Marcus : amused : Count me in! Let's give them a presentation they'll never forget.
:: Nia : determined : That's the spirit! We'll show them that Oddball Industries is a united front, even in the face of the wildest hair disasters.
:: Liam : calculating : You know, I stand to win a lot of money if we pull this off. Art, you better make that haircut work for us!
:: Art : chuckling : I'll do my best, Liam. Now, let's get to work on these hair-raising new looks!
