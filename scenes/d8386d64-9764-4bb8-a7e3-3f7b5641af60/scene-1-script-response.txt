>> [2] > 2/2 - Liam, David
:: Liam : excited : Mate, I've got a hunch this whole "cold" thing is just a cover-up, and Art's really hiding some kind of disastrous hairstyle. What do you reckon?
:: David : amused : Haha, that would be hilarious! You know, we should start a betting pool on what ridiculous hairstyle our dear boss is hiding under that towel.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Rachel, Carmen, Devika
:: Marcus : chuckling : Did you all hear about the betting pool Liam started? I've never seen him so excited, he's practically frothing at the mouth over it!
:: Rachel : giggling : Oh yeah, he's really going all in! I wonder if he has some insider info on Art's mysterious hair situation.
:: Carmen : smirking : Well, you know Liam, always looking for a way to make a quick buck. But honestly, I'm just enjoying the suspense, it's like a daytime soap opera unfolding in our office.
:: Devika : laughing : You're right! I can't wait to see how this all turns out. But let's not forget to keep up with our work, folks - best not to get too distracted with all this hair hullabaloo.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Mike
:: Art : feigning sickness : *cough* I can't believe this is happening to me, Nia! This is a disaster!
:: Nia : trying not to laugh : Art, the more you exaggerate your "illness," the more suspicious everyone gets. You should just face the situation head-on and own your new haircut.
:: Mike : snickering : Yeah, boss, sometimes you just gotta embrace the chaos! And who knows, maybe it'll turn out to be a blessing in disguise.

== In this act, Liam and David start a betting pool on Art's mysterious haircut, and the whole office gets in on the fun. Art continues his fake cold charade, while Nia and Mike encourage him to face the situation. The employees get more excited and involved, anticipating the reveal of Art's disaster haircut, while still managing to keep up with their work.
