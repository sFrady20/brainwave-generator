>> [22] > 2/3 - Arthur Beecham, Nia Jones
:: Arthur Beecham : perplexed : So, this Steven Frady character is garnering more attention than our last office Christmas party, huh? I caught Marko and Rachel doing the "electric shuffle" on that one—quite the scene.
:: Nia Jones : enthusiastic : Absolutely, Art! The digital cosmos is overflowing with tweets, hashtags, and all sorts of viral voodoo. If we can ride this @slowjamsteve wave, we'll be the surfers in the big marketing ocean. Just think of the brand visibility! 

>> [11] > 3/5 - Carmen Vega, Marcus Okonkwo, Liam O'Connell
:: Carmen Vega : eager : If we're surfing the web, count me in, dudes and dudettes! I've got enough energy to power a small meme factory, or at least enough to light up a lighthouse!
:: Marcus Okonkwo : amused : Well, Carmen, if you were a meme, I'd give you the caption 'Java for her java'—caffeine and coding in one vibrant package!
:: Liam O'Connell : confidently : We don't just light up lighthouses, we're the full moon in Oddball Industries' night sky! If there's a rumor that needs spreading, I'm the wildfire you don't need to contain. 

>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel Johnson, David Kent, Devika Sharma
:: Rachel Johnson : gossiping : So guys, have you heard that whispers in the wind say Steven Frady might team up with us on the next project?
:: David Kent : bemused : Teaming up? I thought @slowjamsteve was some kind of solo jazz artist with a penchant for slow internet connections.
:: Devika Sharma : dreamily : Oh, imagine the collaboration! An AI and human symphony, with me conducting an orchestra of ones and zeros. The harmony of it all!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Arthur Beecham, Liam O'Connell, Nia Jones
:: Arthur Beecham : inspired : My fellow Oddballers, let's not just sell software, let's sell dreams! Or at least, let's borrow someone else's dreams for a little marketing magic.
:: Liam O'Connell : boasting : Art, I'm telling you, with my charm and Rachel's network, we could sell refrigerators to penguins. Let's turn these tweets into a symphony!
:: Nia Jones : strategic : Yes, let's orchestrate a tweet storm! But remember, it’s all about the subtlety—like ninjas on a silent disco. Art, your enthusiasm is the spark we need!

== In this act, Art Beecham and Nia Jones have teamed up to create a task force aiming to use the social media hype around Steven Frady for Oddball Industries' benefit. Art is fascinated yet confused by the social media circus, while Nia is ready to harness the energy. Carmen brings her trademark exuberance to the conversation, Marcus delivers witty memes, and Liam oozes his usual overconfidence. The banter between Rachel, David, and Devika showcases their excitement and playful misunderstanding of the Steven Frady phenomenon. The final scene encapsulates Art’s inspirational and somewhat misguided vision, Liam's bravado in spreading rumors, and Nia's strategic thinking, all setting the stage for the ensuing tweet storm they hope to conduct.
