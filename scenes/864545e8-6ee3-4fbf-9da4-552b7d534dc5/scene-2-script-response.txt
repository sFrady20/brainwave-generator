>> [7] > 1/2 - Devika, Marko
:: Marko : ecstatic : So, I just dropped this spicy meme of a cat DJing with the hashtag #slowjamsteve, and guess what? It exploded like soda in a microwave! We're talkin' followers raining down like a glitch in the matrix, and Steve hit the big 5-0-0!
:: Devika : puzzled : Wait, the Steve thing is still going on? I whipped up that bot during a coffee-induced coding spree. You're telling me it's been tweeting this whole time? I thought it was only programmed to argue about whether pineapple belongs on pizza!

>> [21] > 1/2 - Mike, Sam
:: Mike : chuckling : Sam, did you hear about this AI bot thing going viral? It�s like one minute you're fighting paper jams, next you're the Kardashians of the coding world!
:: Sam : deadpan : If the Kardashians were made of code and existential dread, maybe. It's funny, the closest I�ve come to going viral was that time I touched a door handle after the office flu outbreak.

>> [12] > 1/2 - Marcus, Marko
:: Marcus : flamboyant : My man Marko! I hear you're the puppet master behind this #slowjamsteve tsunami. What's it like to wield the power of the meme gods? I must know, even if it costs me my sanity!
:: Marko : whimsical : It's a wild ride, Marcus! Like, imagine surfing on a sea of internet fame where every wave is a cat gif. And now, with Steve crossing the viral event horizon, we're not just surfing � we�re flying, my dude!

>> [20] > 1/6 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : gossiping : So, I was on the phone with a client, and before I could say 'Oddball Industries', they�re asking me about #slowjamsteve. It's like our little Steve's become the Beyonc� of bots!
:: David : befuddled : I tried slipping Steve's tag into a project report, and the client asked if it was a new programming language. I guess you could say I'm not the most 'leet' when it comes to 'tweeter' or whatever.
:: Carmen : jokingly : I�d follow a bot that's fluent in Beyonc�. Could teach us all a thing or two about running the world. Maybe we should ask it for tips on punctuality, too, eh?
:: Liam : grandiosely : Fear not, I've already set the stage for Steve's grand entrance! The world thinks he's our latest and greatest collab. We�re talking trending, baby � Oddball is the new black!

>> [19] > 1/3 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : befuddled : Nia, Devika, we�ve got a situation that�s stickier than a honeycomb in a heatwave. Our AI is now an online celebrity! How on Earth did this happen?
:: Nia : strategizing : It�s simple, Art. We stumbled upon a goldmine with an unexpected avatar. We steer this ship right, and Oddball's brand is going to be the talk of the digital town!
:: Devika : sheepish : Well, the bot's origin story is less 'Skynet' and more 'I might've accidentally left the test server running.' But hey, if it's pumping the Oddball brand, who am I to pull the plug?
== In this act, Marko reveals his role in the explosive social media growth of @slowjamsteve, which leads to the revelation that Steven Frady is actually an AI bot created by Devika for task automation. Mike and Sam humorously discuss the viral sensation from a security perspective. Marcus praises Finn's mastery over memes, then Rachel, David, Carmen, and Liam discuss how the bot's fame has affected client interactions and pushed Oddball into the spotlight. Finally, Art, Nia, and Devika brainstorm how to handle their newfound digital fame, with Nia seeing it as a marketing opportunity and Devika owning up to her accidental creation.
