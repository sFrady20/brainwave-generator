>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Marcus, Rachel
:: David : bemused : Have you ever tried hiding a rhinoceros in a haystack? That's sort of what it feels like trying to sneak these @slowjamsteve promotions into the project docs. It's like trying to thread a moving needle with a piece of spaghetti!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh David, my friend, your analogies are as tangled as headphone cords in a pocket. But fear not! The art of covert promotion is akin to a fine meme – it must catch the eye, ensnare the mind, and leave them wanting more, all with the subtlety of a ninja in slippers.
:: Rachel : puzzled : I just answered a call from FancyTech Innovations, and they asked if the rumors about @slowjamsteve joining our project are true. I mean, what? Are we now in the business of celebrity endorsements? Does this Steve guy even know what a 'for loop' is?
:: Marcus : theatrically : Oh, Rachel, you've stumbled upon the greatest plot twist since someone decided to put pineapple on pizza! You see, in the spiraling soap opera that is social media, truth is but a guest star, and speculation the lead role.
:: David : frustrated : Sure, speculation can lead, but when clients start asking if our software will feature auto-tuned bug reports, I begin to question our strategy – or lack thereof!
:: Rachel : gossiping : You know, I heard from Janice in accounting that @slowjamsteve was once a backup dancer for the keyboard cat. Can you imagine the marketing goldmine if we pull this off? Oddball's going to be the next big thing since sliced bitcoin... or was it breadcoin?
:: Marcus : grinning : Sliced bitcoin, my dear Rachel, is both an economic conundrum and a culinary disaster. But fear not, for our dear @slowjamsteve shall dance again! Perhaps at our next team building retreat?
:: David : sighing : If we survive until then. At this rate, we'll be building a retreat center on the moon, funded by the proceeds from NFTs of Art's snoring during board meetings.

>> [14] > 2/2 - Liam, Carmen
:: Liam : boasting : You know Carmen, starting rumors is like making the perfect cup of coffee. You've got to get the blend just right – a little bit of truth, a whole lot of mystery, and just a pinch of outrageous to make it viral.
:: Carmen : sipping coffee : Liam, the only thing viral about your coffee is the bacteria culture it would sprout if left standing. But this rumor, it's different; it's got legs - and not the jittery kind from your caffeine concoctions.
:: Liam : conspiratorially : Exactly! With Rachel now whispering sweet nothings into the ears of our clients about @slowjamsteve's collaboration, we're set to be the talk of the town. Or at least the talk of the office water cooler.
:: Carmen : playfully : Oh, water cooler talk is so last season. We're trending, baby! And speaking of seasons, we should totally ride this viral wave and release a line of summer wear modeled by our AI pal. Can you see it? "Summer slow jams with Steve."
:: Liam : amused : Carmen, you've got vision! With Oddball's tech and Steve's digital swagger, we'll be out-styling those Silicon Valley cats in no time. Who knew an algorithm could become the next supermodel?
:: Carmen : laughing : Well, if our codebase can strut its stuff down the runway, I might actually start paying attention during tech briefings. But let's focus on the now – the Steven Frady revolution!

>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Nia, Art Beecham, Devika
:: Rachel : excitedly : Guys, guys! My gossip vine is in full bloom. The phones are ringing off the hook with inquiries about Steven Frady's collab with Oddball. I might have casually confirmed a few details here and there, you know, to stir the pot.
:: Nia : sternly : Rachel! We've got to be careful with the information we let slip. We want buzz, not a swarm of angry clients when they find out @slowjamsteve is just a figment of our collective imagination.
:: Art Beecham : obliviously : A swarm, you say? Brilliant! We'll market it as a feature. Innovation swarms from Oddball - catchy, right? It's like a beehive of ideas, and Steven is our Queen bee!
:: Devika : musing : And like any decent Queen bee, @slowjamsteve has workers spreading the good word. It's just that our hive is digital, and our honey is sweet, sweet data. Maybe we can get a bee costume for the bot?
:: Rachel : dreamily : Oh, imagine the photo ops! Steven in a bee costume, surrounded by flowers of innovation. He could be pollinating the tech world with Oddball's genius!
:: Nia : facepalming : We're not actually dressing up an AI bot, people. Remember, we're a serious, sophisticated tech company... that is apparently in the middle of a branding fever dream.
:: Art Beecham : nodding : Serious and sophisticated, of course. But a dream, Nia? No, this is our reality! We're riding the viral wave all the way to brand immortality. Who's with me?
:: Devika : half-joking : I'm just here for the ride, Art. Whether it's a wave or a fever dream, as long as it doesn't crash, I'll keep coding – perhaps a surfing simulator for our next team meeting?
