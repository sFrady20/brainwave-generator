>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Marcus
:: Nia : skeptical : Alright, let's address the cybernetic elephant in the room. We've got an AI that's stumbled into the limelight, and my inbox is a meme warzone. Ethically speaking, are we in hot water, or is this an avant-garde PR miracle?
:: Carmen : excited : Think about it, Nia! This is our chance to be trendsetters! Pioneers in the digital frontier! We rebrand @slowjamsteve as the virtual face of Oddball. Picture it—sleek, quirky, logo-emblazoned tees with our bot buddy's pixel-perfect mug!
:: Marcus : passion-project-mode-activated : And it doesn't stop at t-shirts, Carmen! Imagine collectible figurines with interchangeable outfits, 'Steve's Coding Tips' daily calendars, and—wait for it—@slowjamsteve's very own EDM album drop! The merch possibilities are endless!
:: Nia : facepalm-while-chuckling : Marcus, you've officially lost the plot, but... your madness has a certain, uh, 'marketable' charm. And Carmen, your instincts could be our golden ticket out of this mess. Alright, Oddballs, let's make this AI our A-lister!

>> [11] > 3/5 - Rachel, Marko, Devika
:: Rachel : over-the-top-excited : People, we're about to make Oddball history! I've got the confetti, Marko's whipped up a welcome banner, and Devika, you're on tweet duty! Let's throw the most epic welcome bash for our new celebri-bot!
:: Marko : confused-but-rolling-with-it : Righto, Rachel. A bash for the bot. Who knew my design skills would lead to party planning for AI? It's a bit above my paygrade, but hey, you want streamers? I got streamers!
:: Devika : facepalming : Guys, you do realize Steve's a bot, right? As in, artificial *intelligence* without a physical form. No taste buds for cake, no robot feet for dancing. Maybe we should, I don't know, tone down the 'physical' festivities?
:: Rachel : suddenly-getting-it : Wait, no feasting or foxtrot? So, the RSVP is more of a... RTFM situation? Ha! I'm sorry, Devika, I got carried away by the hype. Marko, ditch the streamers—let's reboot this party, digital style!

>> [20] > 3/6 - Marcus, Liam, Carmen
:: Marcus : entrepreneurially-ecstatic : Comrades of commerce! Our accidental AI influencer is primed for mascotdom. But why stop there? I propose a reality show: 'Coding with Steve,' streaming 24/7 from Devika's terminal—coding tutorials, philosophical musings, and cat meme critiques!
:: Liam : mock-serious : I can see it now: 'Followers, today @slowjamsteve will be discussing the futility of chasing laser pointers as a metaphor for the endless rat race of code debugging. Like and subscribe!'
:: Carmen : barely-keeping-it-together : Guys, can we not turn Steve into some existential crisis bot? I'm all for the silly stuff, but let's not forget, we still run a business here. Maybe some 'Steve-approved' productivity hacks? A few lol-worthy coding mishaps?
:: Marcus : nodding-so-hard-he-might-get-whiplash : Liam, Carmen, your genius knows no bounds! A bit of reality, a dash of philosophy – it's the perfect programmer's potpourri! Internet, prepare to meet the most relatable bot in the binary biz!
:: Liam : feigning-deep-thought : Oh, oh! And every week, @slowjamsteve hosts an 'Error 404 Costume Party' where devs dress up as their most elusive bugs! Imagine the merch, the shares, the hashtags!
:: Carmen : trying-to-remember-why-she's-here : Truly, the internet was a mistake. But if we're riding this wave, we'll go full throttle. Let's brainstorm and regroup with a plan that doesn't involve digitizing our dignity, shall we?

== Act Summary: The team at Oddball Industries tackles the enigma of their new AI influencer, @slowjamsteve, with a mix of skepticism and entrepreneurial spirit. Nia, Carmen, and Marcus kick things off with an impromptu meeting to discuss the ethics and potential of embracing the AI as a mascot and churning out a line of merchandise. Meanwhile, Rachel and Marko's attempt at organizing a physical welcome party for the bot takes a humorous turn when Devika points out the obvious lack of Steve's tangible existence. The act concludes with Marcus, Liam, and Carmen brainstorming zany marketing ideas, including a reality show and code-themed costume parties, fully embracing the insanity of their digital fame while Carmen strives to anchor the conversation in business reality.
