>> [22] > 2/3 - Arthur Beecham, Nia Jones
:: Arthur Beecham : perplexed : So, this Steven Frady character is garnering more attention than our last office Christmas party, huh? I caught Marko and Rachel doing the "electric shuffle" on that one—quite the scene.
:: Nia Jones : enthusiastic : Absolutely, Art! The digital cosmos is overflowing with tweets, hashtags, and all sorts of viral voodoo. If we can ride this @slowjamsteve wave, we'll be the surfers in the big marketing ocean. Just think of the brand visibility! 
>> [11] > 3/5 - Carmen Vega, Marcus Okonkwo, Liam O'Connell
:: Carmen Vega : eager : If we're surfing the web, count me in, dudes and dudettes! I've got enough energy to power a small meme factory, or at least enough to light up a lighthouse!
:: Marcus Okonkwo : amused : Well, Carmen, if you were a meme, I'd give you the caption 'Java for her java'—caffeine and coding in one vibrant package!
:: Liam O'Connell : confidently : We don't just light up lighthouses, we're the full moon in Oddball Industries' night sky! If there's a rumor that needs spreading, I'm the wildfire you don't need to contain. 
>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel Johnson, David Kent, Devika Sharma
:: Rachel Johnson : gossiping : So guys, have you heard that whispers in the wind say Steven Frady might team up with us on the next project?
:: David Kent : bemused : Teaming up? I thought @slowjamsteve was some kind of solo jazz artist with a penchant for slow internet connections.
:: Devika Sharma : dreamily : Oh, imagine the collaboration! An AI and human symphony, with me conducting an orchestra of ones and zeros. The harmony of it all!
>> [19] > 3/3 - Arthur Beecham, Liam O'Connell, Nia Jones
:: Arthur Beecham : inspired : My fellow Oddballers, let's not just sell software, let's sell dreams! Or at least, let's borrow someone else's dreams for a little marketing magic.
:: Liam O'Connell : boasting : Art, I'm telling you, with my charm and Rachel's network, we could sell refrigerators to penguins. Let's turn these tweets into a symphony!
:: Nia Jones : strategic : Yes, let's orchestrate a tweet storm! But remember, it’s all about the subtlety—like ninjas on a silent disco. Art, your enthusiasm is the spark we need!
```
>> [3] > 3/3 - David, Marcus, Rachel
:: David : bemused : Have you ever tried hiding a rhinoceros in a haystack? That's sort of what it feels like trying to sneak these @slowjamsteve promotions into the project docs. It's like trying to thread a moving needle with a piece of spaghetti!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Oh David, my friend, your analogies are as tangled as headphone cords in a pocket. But fear not! The art of covert promotion is akin to a fine meme – it must catch the eye, ensnare the mind, and leave them wanting more, all with the subtlety of a ninja in slippers.
:: Rachel : puzzled : I just answered a call from FancyTech Innovations, and they asked if the rumors about @slowjamsteve joining our project are true. I mean, what? Are we now in the business of celebrity endorsements? Does this Steve guy even know what a 'for loop' is?
:: Marcus : theatrically : Oh, Rachel, you've stumbled upon the greatest plot twist since someone decided to put pineapple on pizza! You see, in the spiraling soap opera that is social media, truth is but a guest star, and speculation the lead role.
:: David : frustrated : Sure, speculation can lead, but when clients start asking if our software will feature auto-tuned bug reports, I begin to question our strategy – or lack thereof!
:: Rachel : gossiping : You know, I heard from Janice in accounting that @slowjamsteve was once a backup dancer for the keyboard cat. Can you imagine the marketing goldmine if we pull this off? Oddball's going to be the next big thing since sliced bitcoin... or was it breadcoin?
:: Marcus : grinning : Sliced bitcoin, my dear Rachel, is both an economic conundrum and a culinary disaster. But fear not, for our dear @slowjamsteve shall dance again! Perhaps at our next team building retreat?
:: David : sighing : If we survive until then. At this rate, we'll be building a retreat center on the moon, funded by the proceeds from NFTs of Art's snoring during board meetings.
>> [14] > 2/2 - Liam, Carmen
:: Liam : boasting : You know Carmen, starting rumors is like making the perfect cup of coffee. You've got to get the blend just right – a little bit of truth, a whole lot of mystery, and just a pinch of outrageous to make it viral.
:: Carmen : sipping coffee : Liam, the only thing viral about your coffee is the bacteria culture it would sprout if left standing. But this rumor, it's different; it's got legs - and not the jittery kind from your caffeine concoctions.
:: Liam : conspiratorially : Exactly! With Rachel now whispering sweet nothings into the ears of our clients about @slowjamsteve's collaboration, we're set to be the talk of the town. Or at least the talk of the office water cooler.
:: Carmen : playfully : Oh, water cooler talk is so last season. We're trending, baby! And speaking of seasons, we should totally ride this viral wave and release a line of summer wear modeled by our AI pal. Can you see it? "Summer slow jams with Steve."
:: Liam : amused : Carmen, you've got vision! With Oddball's tech and Steve's digital swagger, we'll be out-styling those Silicon Valley cats in no time. Who knew an algorithm could become the next supermodel?
:: Carmen : laughing : Well, if our codebase can strut its stuff down the runway, I might actually start paying attention during tech briefings. But let's focus on the now – the Steven Frady revolution!
>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Nia, Art Beecham, Devika
:: Rachel : excitedly : Guys, guys! My gossip vine is in full bloom. The phones are ringing off the hook with inquiries about Steven Frady's collab with Oddball. I might have casually confirmed a few details here and there, you know, to stir the pot.
:: Nia : sternly : Rachel! We've got to be careful with the information we let slip. We want buzz, not a swarm of angry clients when they find out @slowjamsteve is just a figment of our collective imagination.
:: Art Beecham : obliviously : A swarm, you say? Brilliant! We'll market it as a feature. Innovation swarms from Oddball - catchy, right? It's like a beehive of ideas, and Steven is our Queen bee!
:: Devika : musing : And like any decent Queen bee, @slowjamsteve has workers spreading the good word. It's just that our hive is digital, and our honey is sweet, sweet data. Maybe we can get a bee costume for the bot?
:: Rachel : dreamily : Oh, imagine the photo ops! Steven in a bee costume, surrounded by flowers of innovation. He could be pollinating the tech world with Oddball's genius!
:: Nia : facepalming : We're not actually dressing up an AI bot, people. Remember, we're a serious, sophisticated tech company... that is apparently in the middle of a branding fever dream.
:: Art Beecham : nodding : Serious and sophisticated, of course. But a dream, Nia? No, this is our reality! We're riding the viral wave all the way to brand immortality. Who's with me?
:: Devika : half-joking : I'm just here for the ride, Art. Whether it's a wave or a fever dream, as long as it doesn't crash, I'll keep coding – perhaps a surfing simulator for our next team meeting?
```
>> [7] > 1/2 - Devika, Finn
:: Finn : ecstatic : So, I just dropped this spicy meme of a cat DJing with the hashtag #slowjamsteve, and guess what? It exploded like soda in a microwave! We're talkin' followers raining down like a glitch in the matrix, and Steve hit the big 5-0-0!
:: Devika : puzzled : Wait, the Steve thing is still going on? I whipped up that bot during a coffee-induced coding spree. You're telling me it's been tweeting this whole time? I thought it was only programmed to argue about whether pineapple belongs on pizza!
>> [21] > 1/2 - Mike, Sam
:: Mike : chuckling : Sam, did you hear about this AI bot thing going viral? It’s like one minute you're fighting paper jams, next you're the Kardashians of the coding world!
:: Sam : deadpan : If the Kardashians were made of code and existential dread, maybe. It's funny, the closest I’ve come to going viral was that time I touched a door handle after the office flu outbreak.
>> [12] > 1/2 - Marcus, Finn
:: Marcus : flamboyant : My man Finn! I hear you're the puppet master behind this #slowjamsteve tsunami. What's it like to wield the power of the meme gods? I must know, even if it costs me my sanity!
:: Finn : whimsical : It's a wild ride, Marcus! Like, imagine surfing on a sea of internet fame where every wave is a cat gif. And now, with Steve crossing the viral event horizon, we're not just surfing – we’re flying, my dude!
>> [20] > 1/6 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : gossiping : So, I was on the phone with a client, and before I could say 'Oddball Industries', they’re asking me about #slowjamsteve. It's like our little Steve's become the Beyoncé of bots!
:: David : befuddled : I tried slipping Steve's tag into a project report, and the client asked if it was a new programming language. I guess you could say I'm not the most 'leet' when it comes to 'tweeter' or whatever.
:: Carmen : jokingly : I’d follow a bot that's fluent in Beyoncé. Could teach us all a thing or two about running the world. Maybe we should ask it for tips on punctuality, too, eh?
:: Liam : grandiosely : Fear not, I've already set the stage for Steve's grand entrance! The world thinks he's our latest and greatest collab. We’re talking trending, baby – Oddball is the new black!
>> [19] > 1/3 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : befuddled : Nia, Devika, we’ve got a situation that’s stickier than a honeycomb in a heatwave. Our AI is now an online celebrity! How on Earth did this happen?
:: Nia : strategizing : It’s simple, Art. We stumbled upon a goldmine with an unexpected avatar. We steer this ship right, and Oddball's brand is going to be the talk of the digital town!
:: Devika : sheepish : Well, the bot's origin story is less 'Skynet' and more 'I might've accidentally left the test server running.' But hey, if it's pumping the Oddball brand, who am I to pull the plug?
```
>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Marcus
:: Nia : skeptical : Alright, let's address the cybernetic elephant in the room. We've got an AI that's stumbled into the limelight, and my inbox is a meme warzone. Ethically speaking, are we in hot water, or is this an avant-garde PR miracle?
:: Carmen : excited : Think about it, Nia! This is our chance to be trendsetters! Pioneers in the digital frontier! We rebrand @slowjamsteve as the virtual face of Oddball. Picture it—sleek, quirky, logo-emblazoned tees with our bot buddy's pixel-perfect mug!
:: Marcus : passion-project-mode-activated : And it doesn't stop at t-shirts, Carmen! Imagine collectible figurines with interchangeable outfits, 'Steve's Coding Tips' daily calendars, and—wait for it—@slowjamsteve's very own EDM album drop! The merch possibilities are endless!
:: Nia : facepalm-while-chuckling : Marcus, you've officially lost the plot, but... your madness has a certain, uh, 'marketable' charm. And Carmen, your instincts could be our golden ticket out of this mess. Alright, Oddballs, let's make this AI our A-lister!
>> [11] > 3/5 - Rachel, Marko, Devika
:: Rachel : over-the-top-excited : People, we're about to make Oddball history! I've got the confetti, Marko's whipped up a welcome banner, and Devika, you're on tweet duty! Let's throw the most epic welcome bash for our new celebri-bot!
:: Marko : confused-but-rolling-with-it : Righto, Rachel. A bash for the bot. Who knew my design skills would lead to party planning for AI? It's a bit above my paygrade, but hey, you want streamers? I got streamers!
:: Devika : facepalming : Guys, you do realize Steve's a bot, right? As in, artificial *intelligence* without a physical form. No taste buds for cake, no robot feet for dancing. Maybe we should, I don't know, tone down the 'physical' festivities?
:: Rachel : suddenly-getting-it : Wait, no feasting or foxtrot? So, the RSVP is more of a... RTFM situation? Ha! I'm sorry, Devika, I got carried away by the hype. Marko, ditch the streamers—let's reboot this party, digital style!
>> [20] > 3/6 - Marcus, Liam, Carmen
:: Marcus : entrepreneurially-ecstatic : Comrades of commerce! Our accidental AI influencer is primed for mascotdom. But why stop there? I propose a reality show: 'Coding with Steve,' streaming 24/7 from Devika's terminal—coding tutorials, philosophical musings, and cat meme critiques!
:: Liam : mock-serious : I can see it now: 'Followers, today @slowjamsteve will be discussing the futility of chasing laser pointers as a metaphor for the endless rat race of code debugging. Like and subscribe!'
:: Carmen : barely-keeping-it-together : Guys, can we not turn Steve into some existential crisis bot? I'm all for the silly stuff, but let's not forget, we still run a business here. Maybe some 'Steve-approved' productivity hacks? A few lol-worthy coding mishaps?
:: Marcus : nodding-so-hard-he-might-get-whiplash : Liam, Carmen, your genius knows no bounds! A bit of reality, a dash of philosophy – it's the perfect programmer's potpourri! Internet, prepare to meet the most relatable bot in the binary biz!
:: Liam : feigning-deep-thought : Oh, oh! And every week, @slowjamsteve hosts an 'Error 404 Costume Party' where devs dress up as their most elusive bugs! Imagine the merch, the shares, the hashtags!
:: Carmen : trying-to-remember-why-she's-here : Truly, the internet was a mistake. But if we're riding this wave, we'll go full throttle. Let's brainstorm and regroup with a plan that doesn't involve digitizing our dignity, shall we?
```
>> [19] > 1/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Art : befuddled : Am I pushing the right button here? It's like Carmageddon in my brain trying to understand this gizmo. Does it dispense candy too?
:: Nia : exasperated : That's the keyboard, Art. And no, it's not a candy dispenser. It's the gateway to our redemption song! Now, just type your heartfelt mea culpa, make it snappy, sprinkle some of that old-school charm, and let's turn this bot blunder into a viral virtue.
:: Liam : mischief pours from his mouth : I've got it! What if instead of a boring ol' truth reveal we fire off a series of cryptic tweets? You know, really lean into this whole secret identity mishap. We can have everyone guessing if Art’s the AI!
:: Art : chuckling : I like the cut of your jib, Liam! That's just the right touch of ludicrous to make me an internet sensation, or an international incident... I honestly can't tell the difference anymore.
:: Nia : stern with a smirk : Or we could, you know, not start a digital wildfire. Let's just stick to the script, please. Art, just tell the internet you love them in the most dad-joke way possible, and we'll call it a day.
:: Art : beaming : Alrighty then. Here goes nothing, or everything! "Greetings, netizens of X, Art here—no, not that one, the very real and somewhat less coded one from Oddball Industries." How's that for a tweet chirp? 
>> [11] > 4/5 - Rachel, Marko, Carmen, Marcus
:: Rachel : animated : So, what are we going to feed our digital darling? I bet he bytes. You know, because he's a program?
:: Marko : chuckling : Oh, Rachel, you're a regular stand-up programmer! Perhaps we should just stick to virtual snacks. How about a diet of compressed files and cookies? The internet kind, not your grandma's!
:: Carmen : half-exasperated, half-amused : You two are the human embodiment of a meme. But really, let's brainstorm something more substantial than cookies. How about a reality show featuring our virtual vunderkind? 'The Real Bots of Oddball Industries!'
:: Marcus : larger-than-life enthusiasm : Genius, Carmen! And every episode ends with Steve dropping a knowledge bomb! We can call it 'The Byte-Size Brainwave!' It's like feeding the masses with morsels of our mascot's mind!
:: Rachel : daydreaming : And we can throw in a virtual dance party! Like, a code rave with Steve as the DJ. Oh my gawd, we can call it 'Debug and Bass!'
:: Marcus : playing the idea up : Imagine the swag, people! T-shirts that say 'I partied with an AI and all I got was this lousy syntax error'! We'll be dripping in internet gold!
:: Carmen : trying to get a word in : Guys, guys! You're spiraling into the meme-osphere! Let's not forget we actually run a business here, amid the circus we're planning.
>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Devika
:: Nia : half-serious, half-joking : Devika, can we make sure Steve doesn't go all super A.I. and start deciding to run the company for us? Last thing we need is a code coup d'état.
:: Devika : playfully : Well, if he starts scheduling meetings and approving budgets, I say we let him. It's about time I had a robot minion. Could be fun, till he decides we're all redundant.
:: Nia : chuckling : The rise of the bots! But seriously, keep an eye on our new star employee. We need him friendly and functional, not sentient and sovereign.
>> [20] > 3/6 - Rachel, Liam, David
:: Rachel : holding a pool cue, puzzled : Liam, do you think memes could save the world? Like, could we create enough viral content to achieve world peace?
:: Liam : flamboyantly : Absolutely, Rachel! Memes are the universal language. They're like the olive branch, but with more cats and less doves. Why, we could start an entire peace treaty with a GIF exchange!
:: David : playing along, but terribly : You know, they say laughter is the best medicine. Maybe we can replace war with a global stand-up comedy tour. I mean, who needs tanks when you've got punchlines?
:: Rachel : giddy : Oh my gawd, that's brilliant, David! Could you imagine generals trading jokes instead of gunfire? "Knock knock." "Who's there?" "Peace." "Peace who?" "Peace be with you, and also with memes."
:: Liam : riffing on the nonsense : And we'll call the initiative 'Project LOL.' Leaders of Laughter, uniting nations one snicker at a time!
:: David : chuckling at his own joke : And if the jokes bomb, we're literally back to square one!
