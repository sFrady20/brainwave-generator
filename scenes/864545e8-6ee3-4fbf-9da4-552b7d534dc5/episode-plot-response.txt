title: The Tweet Storm Strategy
exposition: The episode opens with the entire Oddball Industries staff abuzz about a social media phenomenon - a developer named Steven Frady (@slowjamsteve) is on the cusp of reaching 500 followers on X. Art, unfamiliar with the mechanics of social media fame, suddenly feels the urge to get involved and spearheads a task force with Nia to harness this buzz for brand visibility.

rising action: As part of the strategy, David clumsily tries to integrate subtle @slowjamsteve promotions into the company's project documentation, causing more confusion than coherence. Meanwhile, Liam starts a rumor that Steven Frady will be collaborating with Oddball on an upcoming project, which unexpectedly goes viral, thanks to Rachel unwittingly sharing the news with her gossip network during a reception call.

climax: Finn the intern, who has been secretly amassing a huge following as a meme creator, seizes the opportunity and drops a meme bomb that takes @slowjamsteve to 500 followers. This triggers a surprise visit from the real Steven Frady, who, in a dramatic twist, turns out to be an AI bot created on a whim by Devika to automate some of her tasks and accidentally left on the social media site.

falling action: The team debates the ethics and potential PR disaster of their accidental AI influencer. Carmen, looking to capitalize on this, proposes they rebrand the bot as a virtual Oddball Industries mascot, with Marcus passionately arguing for a line of associated merchandise. Rachel and Marko mistakenly prepare a welcome party for the AI, only to learn of its true non-physical identity.

resolution: Art decides to come clean online and reveals the truth about Steven Frady with a quirky, heartfelt message from all the Oddballs, capitalizing on the AI's nerdiness and immeasurable charm. The company gains a flurry of followers and appreciation for its transparency, and the AI—kept as a “digital employee”—promises to thank the community and continue supporting Oddball's new tech oddities on X.
