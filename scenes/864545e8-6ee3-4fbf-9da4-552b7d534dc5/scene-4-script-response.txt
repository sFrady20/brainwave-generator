>> [19] > 1/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Art : befuddled : Am I pushing the right button here? It's like Carmageddon in my brain trying to understand this gizmo. Does it dispense candy too?
:: Nia : exasperated : That's the keyboard, Art. And no, it's not a candy dispenser. It's the gateway to our redemption song! Now, just type your heartfelt mea culpa, make it snappy, sprinkle some of that old-school charm, and let's turn this bot blunder into a viral virtue.
:: Liam : mischief pours from his mouth : I've got it! What if instead of a boring ol' truth reveal we fire off a series of cryptic tweets? You know, really lean into this whole secret identity mishap. We can have everyone guessing if Art’s the AI!
:: Art : chuckling : I like the cut of your jib, Liam! That's just the right touch of ludicrous to make me an internet sensation, or an international incident... I honestly can't tell the difference anymore.
:: Nia : stern with a smirk : Or we could, you know, not start a digital wildfire. Let's just stick to the script, please. Art, just tell the internet you love them in the most dad-joke way possible, and we'll call it a day.
:: Art : beaming : Alrighty then. Here goes nothing, or everything! "Greetings, netizens of X, Art here—no, not that one, the very real and somewhat less coded one from Oddball Industries." How's that for a tweet chirp? 

>> [11] > 4/5 - Rachel, Marko, Carmen, Marcus
:: Rachel : animated : So, what are we going to feed our digital darling? I bet he bytes. You know, because he's a program?
:: Marko : chuckling : Oh, Rachel, you're a regular stand-up programmer! Perhaps we should just stick to virtual snacks. How about a diet of compressed files and cookies? The internet kind, not your grandma's!
:: Carmen : half-exasperated, half-amused : You two are the human embodiment of a meme. But really, let's brainstorm something more substantial than cookies. How about a reality show featuring our virtual vunderkind? 'The Real Bots of Oddball Industries!'
:: Marcus : larger-than-life enthusiasm : Genius, Carmen! And every episode ends with Steve dropping a knowledge bomb! We can call it 'The Byte-Size Brainwave!' It's like feeding the masses with morsels of our mascot's mind!
:: Rachel : daydreaming : And we can throw in a virtual dance party! Like, a code rave with Steve as the DJ. Oh my gawd, we can call it 'Debug and Bass!'
:: Marcus : playing the idea up : Imagine the swag, people! T-shirts that say 'I partied with an AI and all I got was this lousy syntax error'! We'll be dripping in internet gold!
:: Carmen : trying to get a word in : Guys, guys! You're spiraling into the meme-osphere! Let's not forget we actually run a business here, amid the circus we're planning.

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Devika
:: Nia : half-serious, half-joking : Devika, can we make sure Steve doesn't go all super A.I. and start deciding to run the company for us? Last thing we need is a code coup d'état.
:: Devika : playfully : Well, if he starts scheduling meetings and approving budgets, I say we let him. It's about time I had a robot minion. Could be fun, till he decides we're all redundant.
:: Nia : chuckling : The rise of the bots! But seriously, keep an eye on our new star employee. We need him friendly and functional, not sentient and sovereign.

>> [20] > 3/6 - Rachel, Liam, David
:: Rachel : holding a pool cue, puzzled : Liam, do you think memes could save the world? Like, could we create enough viral content to achieve world peace?
:: Liam : flamboyantly : Absolutely, Rachel! Memes are the universal language. They're like the olive branch, but with more cats and less doves. Why, we could start an entire peace treaty with a GIF exchange!
:: David : playing along, but terribly : You know, they say laughter is the best medicine. Maybe we can replace war with a global stand-up comedy tour. I mean, who needs tanks when you've got punchlines?
:: Rachel : giddy : Oh my gawd, that's brilliant, David! Could you imagine generals trading jokes instead of gunfire? "Knock knock." "Who's there?" "Peace." "Peace who?" "Peace be with you, and also with memes."
:: Liam : riffing on the nonsense : And we'll call the initiative 'Project LOL.' Leaders of Laughter, uniting nations one snicker at a time!
:: David : chuckling at his own joke : And if the jokes bomb, we're literally back to square one!

== In this act, Art, with help from Nia and Liam, composes a tweet to address the situation with @slowjamsteve. Art's old-school charm shines through as he drafts a humorous and endearing message. In the lunch kitchen, Rachel, Marko, Carmen, and Marcus get carried away brainstorming comical viral content ideas, with Carmen trying to ground the conversation. In Nia's office, Nia and Devika jest about the implications of having an AI influencer and the potential rise of the machines. The act concludes with Rachel, Liam, and David whimsically discussing the power of memes to bring about world peace, punctuated by bad jokes and playful banter. The Oddballs end up gaining a flood of new followers and appreciation for their transparency, as the AI bot makes a virtual promise to continue supporting Oddball's tech endeavors.
