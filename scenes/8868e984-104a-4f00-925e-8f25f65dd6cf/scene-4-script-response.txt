>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Liam
:: Liam : frantically : Art, Nia, you won't believe this madness! We've found the source of all our recent "government" paranoia! Our beloved CEO, the boss of all bosses, was reading a sci-fi screenplay during his sleep episode!
:: Art : befuddled : What? I did? I was just trying to relax before the meeting and... Oh, dear. I must have drifted off and started sleep-talking.
:: Nia : sarcastically : Well, that's just great, Art. Now we've got the whole office buzzing around like headless chickens, making meme references and sprouting conspiracy theories like no tomorrow.
:: Art : sheepishly : I'm sorry, everyone. I'll make it up to you, I promise. But first, let's get the office back to normal. Or, you know, Oddball Industries' version of normal.

>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, David
:: Marcus : excitedly : David! I just heard the news! We're all going to be alright! Turns out Art was just sleep reading, and there's no shady government conspiracy after all!
:: David : animatedly : No way, Marcus! That's amazing! And to think I was just debating whether I should finally reveal my secret recipe for laser-guided tacos to the world. Boy, that escaped disaster like a sneaky cat gif!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Rachel, Carmen, Devika
:: Rachel : relieved : So, the truth is out, huh? Art's secret sci-fi screenplay reading had us all worked up for nothing!
:: Carmen : giggling : It's a good thing we didn't need to use Mike's "Feline Defense Plan" after all. That would have been catastrophic!
:: Devika : chuckling : You guys, we need to make a comic out of this. Just imagine the title, "Sleep-Talking CEO: The Alien Conspiracy That Wasn't!" The internet would go nuts!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Marko, Samantha, Michael
:: Nia : addressing : Alright, everyone. Now that this little adventure is resolved, let's get back to work. No more wild theories and chasing non-existent government agents, okay?
:: Marko : cheerfully : You got it, Nia! I can finally focus on my designs again without worrying about secret microphones in my keyboard!
:: Samantha : dryly : Well, at least we know our security measures can be relaxed a bit. No need to go full-on "Area 51" mode anymore.
:: Michael : jovially : Good times, Oddballs, good times! Now I can finally return to my never-ending battle against the ultimate office adversary...the jammed printer!

== In this act, the employees find out there was no government conspiracy, and it was just Art sleep-talking about a sci-fi screenplay. Once they learn the truth, they all react with humorous relief and share comical anecdotes about their recent paranoia. The office reunites in a burst of laughter and the normalcy of their oddball ways is restored.
