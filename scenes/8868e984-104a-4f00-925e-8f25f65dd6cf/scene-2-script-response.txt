>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : exasperated : Nia, have you heard the nonsense spreading around the office? They actually believe we're running secret government projects with aliens and talking unicorns! It's absurd!
:: Nia : concerned : I've heard, Art. It's getting out of control. People are pairing up and gossiping instead of working. We need to put a stop to this. What if we call an emergency All Hands Meeting to clear the air and explain that it's all just a big misunderstanding?
:: Art : agreeing : That's a good idea, Nia. Let's get everyone into the conference room right away! 

>> [16] > 7/7 - Art, Nia, Liam, Carmen, David, Rachel, Marcus
:: Art : authoritative : Alright, everyone, listen up! We've called this emergency meeting because it's come to our attention that there's a ridiculous rumor going around about secret government projects and Oddball Industries. We want to assure you, it's all just baseless gossip. We're not involved in any secret projects or conspiracies.
:: Liam : smirking : But what if we are, Art? What if you're just saying that to throw us off the trail? To keep us from discovering the truth about the interdimensional portals and the time-traveling goldfish?
:: Carmen : laughing : Liam, are you seriously suggesting that Art is involved in some sort of futuristic aquatic espionage? You've been watching too many sci-fi movies, dude! 
:: Rachel : conspiratorial : Well, I did overhear Art sleep talking about aliens and oddball-themed government projects... It could be a repressed memory surfacing!
:: Nia : frustrated : Rachel, sometimes people just say nonsensical things in their sleep. It doesn't mean there's a secret conspiracy. We've got a company to run, and we can't afford to get sidetracked by baseless rumors.

>> [15] > 5/5 - David, Devika, Marko, Sam, Mike
:: David : jokingly : So, Devika, have you been secretly developing holographic aliens for the government in your secluded corner cubicle?
:: Devika : rolling her eyes : David, if I had the technology to create holographic aliens, I'd use it to make my own personal army of intergalactic warriors, not to help the government with their silly schemes.
:: Marko : grinning : Speaking of intergalactic warriors, did you hear about the guy who tried to train his goldfish to be an astronaut? He thought it would be out-of-this-world!
:: Sam : annoyed : Honestly, can we all just drop the conspiracies and get back to work? This is getting ridiculous.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Carmen, Liam, Marcus
:: Nia : disheartened : I can't believe things have escalated this far. Instead of calming everyone down, the meeting has led to even more division among the employees.
:: Carmen : amused : Well, you know what they say, Nia: "All's fair in love, war, and office conspiracy theories!"
:: Liam : joking : Carmen, you should form a team to investigate the existence of interdimensional portals at Oddball Industries. I bet we could get a reality TV show out of it!
:: Marcus : dramatically : Count me in! I was born to uncover the truth... and star in my own reality show, darling.

== In this act, Art and Nia call an emergency All Hands Meeting to dispel the conspiracy theories, but things escalate as employees become divided into pro and anti-conspiracy teams. The characters engage in playful banter and poke fun at the absurdity of the conspiracy theories, adding to the humorous and chaotic atmosphere of the storyline.
