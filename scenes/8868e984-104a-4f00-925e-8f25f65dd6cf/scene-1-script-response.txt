>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, David, Carmen
:: Liam : suspicious : David mate, you ever notice anything off about Art? Like, maybe he's hiding something?
:: David : clumsily : Well, I mean, he does have a strange fascination with oddball-themed projects. But hiding something? C'mon, Liam, you sound like one of those conspiracy nuts!
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely! I mean, just the other day, I saw Art communicating with aliens through the coffee machine. We're all just pawns in his intergalactic game!

>> [2] > 2/2 - Marcus, Devika
:: Marcus : laughing : Can you imagine? Art, the puppet master of some secret government project! I mean, the man can't even stay awake during an office meeting!
:: Devika : amused : It's ridiculous, but you have to admit, it's kind of fun to entertain the idea. What if we're all here just to help him make first contact with a race of super intelligent oddballs?

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Nia, Marko, Sam
:: Rachel : nervously : Guys, I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get a little paranoid. What if there's some truth to this conspiracy theory?
:: Nia : dismissive : Rachel, it's just a silly rumor. But, I have to admit, it's been quite entertaining watching everyone freak out over it.
:: Marko : joking : Yeah, I mean, I was this close to creating a whole line of tinfoil hats to sell at the Oddball Industries gift shop!
:: Sam : deadpan : Oh, please. Let's all stick tinfoil hats on our heads and skip merrily through the office. That'll really boost productivity, won't it?
