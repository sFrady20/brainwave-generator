>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : panicked : Guys, those investigators are in the building! Everyone is running around frantically.
:: David : stuttering : W-w-we have to hide! They must be after our secrets! Oh, man, I knew I should've cleaned up my desk before they got here...
:: Carmen : sarcastic : Relax, David. They're investigators, not your mom coming to visit your college dorm. But seriously, we can't let them find anything that could put us on their radar.
:: Marcus : comically serious : I propose we create a divide-and-conquer strategy. Let's split up, hide, and report any findings we come across. Just remember, we have to act natural, like nothing's out of the ordinary.
:: David : nervously laughing : Yeah, hiding from investigators is completely an ordinary day for me...totally natural.

>> [12] > 2/2 - Nia, Marcus
:: Nia : whispering : Marcus, what's going on? The entire office is in chaos! What did you find out?
:: Marcus : cautiously : Nia, I've got some intel. Looks like they're searching people's desks and asking questions. It's not looking good for our cover.
:: Nia : determined : Okay, we need to regroup and come up with a plan. We can't let them uncover the truth behind Art's wild sci-fi screenplay reading!

>> [6] > 2/3 - Liam, Rachel
:: Liam : over-exaggerating : Rachel, it's like we're being hunted down. I saw an investigator in the corner of my eye, and I swear I saw a laser dot on my chest.
:: Rachel : eye-rolling : Liam, that's just paranoia talking. But seriously, we need to stick together and be stealthy about this entire situation.

== In this act, the office is in full panic mode, with everyone constantly moving from one hidden corner to another, trying to stay away from the investigators. The employees act comically paranoid and reveal their quirks, with Liam's wild exaggerations, David's nervous laughter, and Marcus's overly dramatic suggestions. Conversations are filled with off-topic jokes and banter that poke fun at the absurdity of the situation. Through the chaos, the Oddballs attempt to keep the investigators from discovering the truth about Art's late-night sci-fi screenplay reading.
