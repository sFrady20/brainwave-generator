>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, Carmen, David
:: Rachel : excitedly : Guys, you won't believe what I just heard! Art was sleep-talking during an important meeting, and he mentioned something about secret government projects related to oddball stuff. Do you think we could be involved in something shady?
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Oh, sure, Rachel. And maybe we're all alien lizard people in disguise, controlling the world's governments from our humble software company. Pass me a tin-foil hat, will you?
:: David : chuckling : Yeah, Rachel, next you'll be telling us that the earth is flat and the moon landing was staged. But, you know, now that you mention it, I did once see a UFO outside my window... or maybe it was just a really shiny bird.

>> [11] > 3/4 - Nia, Devika, Liam
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : So, Rachel's been spreading some wild conspiracy theory about us being involved in oddball-themed government projects. Honestly, can't people just focus on work?
:: Devika : musing : Well, I have to admit, it's a pretty entertaining thought. Maybe we're secretly developing mind-reading apps or, you know, lizard people dating sites? You never know what's going on behind closed doors.
:: Liam : smirking : Hey, if we're developing mind-reading apps, I'd love to know what our competitors are thinking right now. But seriously, if we were involved in something like that, I think we'd know by now.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, Mike, Rachel
:: Marcus : chuckling : I heard about your wild government conspiracy, Rachel. It's quite the imaginative tale you've cooked up. But what if... we're actually living inside a computer simulation, huh? How do we know anything is real? 
:: Mike : raising an eyebrow : You've been watching too many Matrix movies, Marcus. But, you know, now that you bring it up, sometimes when I walk through the office, I feel like I can hear a distant voice saying, "Error 404: Page Not Found."
:: Rachel : defensively : Hey, I'm just saying what I heard! Art was sleep-talking about it, and it sounded really, uh, juicy. Look, I know it sounds crazy, but don't you think there's a tiny chance we could be part of something bigger?

== In this act, Rachel shares the conspiracy theory about Oddball Industries' involvement in secret government projects, setting off widespread paranoia among her coworkers. Colleagues entertain the idea with their own absurd suggestions while poking fun at the theory, but somewhere deep down, they begin to question the possible truth behind it.
