title: Alienating Conspiracy
exposition: When Rachel overhears Art sleep-talking about secret oddball-themed government projects during an important meeting, she can't resist sharing the information with the rest of the office, creating widespread paranoia.

rising action: Fearing they're being monitored, various characters reluctantly pair up in suspicion while the whole office becomes engaged in comical conspiracy theories. Consequently, a tense vibe spreads as the employees speculate each other's involvement with these mysterious government projects.

climax: Getting wind of this growing gossip, Art and Nia call an emergency All Hands Meeting in a desperate attempt to dissipate the escalating chaos. However, rather than saving the day, things escalate when more Oddballs are split into pro and anti-conspiracy teams.

falling action: With office morale at an all-time low, investigators enter the building to check for potential leaks. The entire office begins to panic, plaguing watchers with constant scene switches to hidden corners to dodge a hit fantasy.

resolution: Running out of corners to evade the trap, the employees finally learn there was no government conspiracy after all—it was Art reading an unfinished sci-fi screenplay aloud for pleasure amidst a typical sleep episode! A huge burst of laughter and relief break the tension and restores some level of normalcy back at the good ol' Offbeat Offices.
