title: Kevin Kabbage Catastrophe
exposition: Art invites lotto-winning pop culture icon Kevin Kabbage to give an inspirational, high energy speech about following dreams, generational wealth and finally realizing it is Tuesdays that sink his life. Not everyone in the Oddball Industries is pleased with Art's decision. Rachel, the receptionist and self-proclaimed collector of absurd conspiracy theories, is sure Kevin has psychic mind control abilities used for nefarious purposes.

rising action: Rachel devises a plan to prevent any psychic manipulation from Kevin Kabbage. She enlists the help of her odd coworker circle in executing a series of bizarre tactics and outlandish, endearing costumes while Kevin speaks to dull the effectiveness of the entire mind control plan. At this point, they may not even care if Rachel is correct, they just significantly enjoy wearing plaid skirts backward.

climax: Marcus overhears Kevin Kabbage in a conversation while standing by the printer out of functional necessity, as all his copy must fulfill a printed mandate. In this conversation, Kevin reveals his big secret - he's actually composed his entire personality to appeal more like the everyman's wild and mysterious friend. He's "cultivated" viral moments as his relatable expressions; much like "Fridays haunt me" true-to-life sentiments. 

falling action: Marcus can't help but share the truth about Kevin with others, each of which doesn't seem phased about it ("Oh, someone on TV doing things specifically for money and emojis? Inconcievable!"). They carry on as intended, oblivious to Marcus now exponentially flipping phrases that vaguely reference the days of our given weeks.

resolution: Just as Kevin finishes his highly disjointed speech and prepares to leave the Oddball Industries headquarters, he stumbles upon one of the group's wacky costume plots—even traps if gentle—apparently renamed to "phases of Weekend Nincompoops." Feignedly vexed at the confusion and character besmirching extent they've reached by his staying power alone, almost shows: amused and impressed, Kevin decides to work that bit into his next memetastic adventure, concluding that no more intrigue need leech from week threads. Entitlement sinks like butter on marble sidewalks. The team satisfies a collective guffaw; Rachel continues theorizing, but everyone will always remember the time life memes came (& Kabbage (™)) and conquered their imaginations.
