>> [11] > 3/4 - Marcus, Liam, Carmen
:: Marcus : flabbergasted : You guys won't believe what I just overheard! Kevin Kabbage, our beloved meme king, admitted that his entire personality is a carefully crafted act designed to keep him popular on the internet. I mean, who would've thought?
:: Liam : sarcastic : Oh, Marcus, color me shocked! A celebrity who's all about money and fame? That's the most unbelievable thing I've ever heard!
:: Carmen : laughing : Yeah, I can't say I'm surprised, although it is a bit disappointing. I liked the idea of him being a genuine dude. But hey, I guess we all have to make a living somehow, right?

>> [9] > 2/3 - David, Marko
:: David : chuckling : Man, this Kabbage revelation seems to be bothering Marcus more than anyone else. I wonder why he's taken it so personally.
:: Marko : amused : Who knows? Maybe he wanted Kevin to be the genuine article, you know, someone who's just doing their thing without all the marketing and manipulation. But hey, that's showbiz for you, mate!

>> [15] > 4/5 - Nia, Devika, Rachel, Sam
:: Nia : quizzical : So, Rachel, now that we know Kevin's persona is an act, how does that impact your theory about his psychic mind control abilities?
:: Rachel : determined : Well, it doesn't change the fact that we need to protect ourselves from any potential mind control attempts. If anything, it makes me more suspicious of him!
:: Devika : rolling her eyes : Seriously, Rachel? At this point, I think you're just trying to keep this ridiculous conspiracy theory alive. We've got work to do, you know.
:: Sam : deadpan : As the voice of reason here, can we please drop this nonsense and focus on our jobs? I'd rather not spend my entire day discussing Kevin Kabbage's motives.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Art, Marcus, Liam
:: Art : considering : Even though Kevin's not as genuine as we thought, it doesn't change the fact that he's still an entertaining guy. Maybe we should just enjoy the ride while it lasts.
:: Marcus : sighing : I suppose you're right, Art. I just don't like the idea of people pretending to be something they're not. But hey, if he's making us laugh, I guess that's what counts.
:: Liam : grinning : Now that's the spirit! Let's strap in for the Kabbage rollercoaster and see where it takes us. Who knows, we might even learn a thing or two along the way!

== In this act, Marcus shares the truth about Kevin Kabbage's persona with his coworkers, but they remain unfazed by the revelation. The team decides to enjoy the ride and focus on their work, despite Rachel's continued insistence on protecting themselves from potential mind control. Art reminds everyone to stay focused on the positive, and the staff at Oddball Industries start to see the humor in the situation.
