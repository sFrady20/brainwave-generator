>> [17] > 2/2 - Marcus, Kevin
:: Marcus : grumbling : This darn printer is about as reliable as a politician during election season. 
:: Kevin : chuckling : Ah, yeah, I feel you on that one. It's all about the show, am I right?

:: Marcus : surprised : Oh, uh, hi there, Mr. Kabbage. Didn't expect to see you here. You know, just maintaining the copy-making machinery. 
:: Kevin : casual : Hey, no worries! I'm just here to grab some water before I hit the road. But, you know what? It's kind of a relief to have a normal conversation for a change. 

:: Marcus : curious : A relief? What do you mean?
:: Kevin : sighing : Well, to be honest, this whole viral sensation thing is a bit exhausting. I mean, I've had to carefully cultivate my entire public persona just to maintain my relevance. Plus, I'm constantly trying to come up with new, relatable catchphrases to keep people entertained. It's like I can't even have a normal conversation anymore without slipping into my "Kevin Kabbage" character.

:: Marcus : flabbergasted : That... that's actually kind of surprising. I thought you really enjoyed being the outrageous "everyman's wild friend."
:: Kevin : admitting : Well, it definitely has its perks, but sometimes I just want to unwind and be myself without the constant pressure to perform.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : eager : Guys, you won't believe what I just overheard while I was at the printer. Kevin Kabbage revealed that he's basically an act! He's created this whole persona for the sake of going viral and staying relevant. Can you believe it?
:: Nia : sarcastically : Oh, someone on TV doing things specifically for money and emojis? Inconceivable!
:: Rachel : unfazed : I mean, it doesn't change the fact that he might still have mind control powers, but it's interesting to know he's just as fake as everyone else in the biz.
:: David : chuckling : Well, I guess that just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Or a viral sensation by their catchphrases.

:: Carmen : smirking : That actually makes our little plan even more entertaining. We're not just countering potential mind control, we're also giving Mr. Kabbage a taste of good ol' Oddball Industries chaos. 
:: Nia : laughing : I couldn't agree more, Carmen. We're going to show him what real, unscripted fun looks like. Oddball style.

== In this act, Marcus overhears Kevin Kabbage discussing how his entire public persona is an act designed to maintain his viral popularity. Surprised, Marcus shares this revelation with his coworkers, who remain unfazed but more committed to their plan to protect themselves from potential mind control and show Kevin the chaos that is Oddball Industries.
