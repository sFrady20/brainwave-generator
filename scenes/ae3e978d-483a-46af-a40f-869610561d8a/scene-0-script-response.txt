>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : excitedly : Folks, you won't believe it! We scored a big win for Oddball Industries! Kevin Kabbage, the legendary lotto-winning, pop culture icon, is coming to give a motivational speech full of inspirational energy and... whatever else he does!
:: Nia : skeptically : Art, are you sure it's a good idea to have him here? I mean, he's not exactly known for his... sobriety, if you know what I mean.
:: Marcus : chuckling : Yeah, Art, the man's claim to fame is screaming about Tuesdays and having too much money.

>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : panicked : If we don't do something, Oddball Industries may fall under the control of Kevin Kabbage's psychic mind powers! I'm sure he has some nefarious scheme planned, and we need to stop it!
:: David : trying not to laugh : Rachel, are you sure you're not getting a bit carried away? I mean, the guy's a walking meme, not a supervillain.
:: Carmen : joking : Well, if our office gets taken over by psychic powers, at least it'll be a fun story to tell, right?
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, and we could always use a little excitement around here. Who knows, maybe it'll boost our sales if we're all acting like lunatics.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Marcus, Carmen, David
:: Rachel : conspiratorially : Listen up, team. We need to devise a plan to keep Kevin's psychic powers at bay. I propose we all wear ridiculous costumes and engage in wacky tactics while he's speaking, just to make sure we don't fall under his spell.
:: Marcus : grinning : You know what, Rachel? That's so insane, it just might work! I'm on board.
:: Carmen : laughing : I'm always up for a bit of harmless mischief. Count me in!
:: David : reluctantly : Fine, I'll join too. But only because it seems like it'll be a hilarious disaster.

== Art reluctantly agrees to let Rachel and the crew execute their ludicrous plan to counter Kevin Kabbage's alleged psychic mind control. The employees begin planning their costumes and wacky tactics, excited for a change of pace in the office. As the team unites to protect Oddball Industries from the possible psychic threat, they become more focused on the hilarity of the situation and not whether Rachel's conspiracy theories are actually true.
