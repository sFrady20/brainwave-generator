>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Marcus, Carmen, David
:: Art : chuckling : Well, I must say, Kevin's speech was quite the experience. Hats off to Rachel for keeping us all on our toes with her conspiracy theories! At least it made for a memorable Tuesday, huh?
:: Marcus : laughing : Indeed, Art! Today has been a rollercoaster ride, to say the least. I say we go out there and show the world how Oddball Industries turns life's memes into reality!
:: Carmen : smirking : You mean the Weekend Nincompoops? It was certainly a hoot! I think we all needed a little whimsy in our lives. Plus, those plaid skirts really show off my calves!
:: David : snickering : I haven't laughed this hard in ages. And who knew I could rock a backward skirt like that? I think I've found my new fashion statement!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Devika, Rachel
:: Liam : grinning : Look at Rachel, still carrying on about mind control. You gotta give her credit for dedication, though. 
:: Devika : amused : True, but you have to admit, this whole Kevin Kabbage thing brought us all closer. We bonded over the absurdity of it all.
:: Rachel : determined : Mark my words, folks! One day, you'll see the truth behind Kevin Kabbage's psychic powers. Until then, I'll continue my crusade for the greater good!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Marcus, David, Rachel
:: Art : content : You know, I think we all learned something valuable today. No matter how crazy our lives get, it's important to find the humor in every situation.
:: Nia : smiling : That's true, Art. Today was a great reminder that we should never take ourselves too seriously.
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : Absolutely! Laughter helps clear the smoke and reconnect us to our true selves.
:: David : agreeing : Yeah, and our little adventures showed us that even in the most unexpected moments, we can come together as a team.
:: Rachel : steadfast : Well, I'm still keeping an eye on Kevin Kabbage. But in the meantime, it's nice to know we can all count on each other to face any challenges – or mind control – that may come our way.

== In this act, Kevin Kabbage stumbles upon one of the group's wacky costume plots and is both amused and impressed. He decides to work the bit into his next memetastic adventure, and the team at Oddball Industries finds satisfaction in their collective laugh. Rachel continues theorizing about Kevin's psychic powers, but the rest of the staff bonds over the absurdity of the situation and grows stronger as a team.
