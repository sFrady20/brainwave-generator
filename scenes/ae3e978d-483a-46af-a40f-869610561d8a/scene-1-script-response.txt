>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : excited : Alright, everyone, gather 'round! I have come up with the perfect plan to counteract Kevin Kabbage's psychic mind control. All we need to do is to adopt these ridiculously insane tactics and don these absolutely endearing costumes. Trust me, as long as we're looking this absurd, no mind control is getting through to us!
:: David : amused : Plaid skirts, backward? Rachel, you've truly outdone yourself this time. I love it! I guess I never realized just how much my life was missing a backward plaid skirt until now.
:: Carmen : grinning : You know, at this point, it doesn't even matter if Rachel is right about the mind control. I'm just having a blast planning all these wacky outfits and shenanigans.
:: Liam : laughing : Oh, absolutely! I mean, who wouldn't want to dress up like a deranged bagpipe player in the middle of the office? Count me in, Rachel!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Rachel, Marcus, Devika, Marko, Sam
:: Rachel : conspiratorially : So, I've gathered you all here in the break room to go over the tactics we'll be using during Kevin Kabbage's speech. Remember to stay focused and keep your costumes outrageous. Together, we will defeat the psychic menace!
:: Marcus : smirking : I've never been more ready to look like a lunatic for the sake of protecting our minds. I've always said that Tuesdays are trying to control me, and now we have a chance to fight back!
:: Devika : chuckling : I still can't believe we're doing this, but I've got to admit, it's a refreshing change from the usual office work. Plus, I've got the perfect pair of mismatched socks for this occasion.
:: Marko : grinning : Mate, I've been waiting for a reason to wear this ridiculous wig I bought on a whim. Now's the perfect opportunity! Let's get wild, team!
:: Sam : smirking : I'm not one for costumes, but I have to admit, this is kind of fun. Let's show this psychic mind controller what Oddball Industries is made of!

>> [20] > 3/3 - Rachel, Nia, Art
:: Rachel : confidently : Nia, Art, thanks for joining us in our quest to take down the psychic threat! Remember, the key is to be as ridiculous as possible. Don't hold back on the absurdity.
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : Honestly, Rachel, I still can't believe we're doing this, but if it brings the team together and boosts morale, I'm willing to give it a shot. Let's circle back on these tactics and touch base on our costumes later, alright?
:: Art : chuckling : Well, I genuinely never thought I'd see the day where we're all dressing up like mad hatters in the office, but I suppose that's just the spirit of Oddball Industries! Let's show Kevin Kabbage that we're not so easily controlled!
