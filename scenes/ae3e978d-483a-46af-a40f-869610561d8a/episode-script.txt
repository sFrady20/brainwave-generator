>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Marcus
:: Art : excitedly : Folks, you won't believe it! We scored a big win for Oddball Industries! Kevin Kabbage, the legendary lotto-winning, pop culture icon, is coming to give a motivational speech full of inspirational energy and... whatever else he does!
:: Nia : skeptically : Art, are you sure it's a good idea to have him here? I mean, he's not exactly known for his... sobriety, if you know what I mean.
:: Marcus : chuckling : Yeah, Art, the man's claim to fame is screaming about Tuesdays and having too much money.
>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : panicked : If we don't do something, Oddball Industries may fall under the control of Kevin Kabbage's psychic mind powers! I'm sure he has some nefarious scheme planned, and we need to stop it!
:: David : trying not to laugh : Rachel, are you sure you're not getting a bit carried away? I mean, the guy's a walking meme, not a supervillain.
:: Carmen : joking : Well, if our office gets taken over by psychic powers, at least it'll be a fun story to tell, right?
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, and we could always use a little excitement around here. Who knows, maybe it'll boost our sales if we're all acting like lunatics.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, Marcus, Carmen, David
:: Rachel : conspiratorially : Listen up, team. We need to devise a plan to keep Kevin's psychic powers at bay. I propose we all wear ridiculous costumes and engage in wacky tactics while he's speaking, just to make sure we don't fall under his spell.
:: Marcus : grinning : You know what, Rachel? That's so insane, it just might work! I'm on board.
:: Carmen : laughing : I'm always up for a bit of harmless mischief. Count me in!
:: David : reluctantly : Fine, I'll join too. But only because it seems like it'll be a hilarious disaster.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Liam
:: Rachel : excited : Alright, everyone, gather 'round! I have come up with the perfect plan to counteract Kevin Kabbage's psychic mind control. All we need to do is to adopt these ridiculously insane tactics and don these absolutely endearing costumes. Trust me, as long as we're looking this absurd, no mind control is getting through to us!
:: David : amused : Plaid skirts, backward? Rachel, you've truly outdone yourself this time. I love it! I guess I never realized just how much my life was missing a backward plaid skirt until now.
:: Carmen : grinning : You know, at this point, it doesn't even matter if Rachel is right about the mind control. I'm just having a blast planning all these wacky outfits and shenanigans.
:: Liam : laughing : Oh, absolutely! I mean, who wouldn't want to dress up like a deranged bagpipe player in the middle of the office? Count me in, Rachel!
>> [15] > 5/5 - Rachel, Marcus, Devika, Marko, Sam
:: Rachel : conspiratorially : So, I've gathered you all here in the break room to go over the tactics we'll be using during Kevin Kabbage's speech. Remember to stay focused and keep your costumes outrageous. Together, we will defeat the psychic menace!
:: Marcus : smirking : I've never been more ready to look like a lunatic for the sake of protecting our minds. I've always said that Tuesdays are trying to control me, and now we have a chance to fight back!
:: Devika : chuckling : I still can't believe we're doing this, but I've got to admit, it's a refreshing change from the usual office work. Plus, I've got the perfect pair of mismatched socks for this occasion.
:: Marko : grinning : Mate, I've been waiting for a reason to wear this ridiculous wig I bought on a whim. Now's the perfect opportunity! Let's get wild, team!
:: Sam : smirking : I'm not one for costumes, but I have to admit, this is kind of fun. Let's show this psychic mind controller what Oddball Industries is made of!
>> [20] > 3/3 - Rachel, Nia, Art
:: Rachel : confidently : Nia, Art, thanks for joining us in our quest to take down the psychic threat! Remember, the key is to be as ridiculous as possible. Don't hold back on the absurdity.
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : Honestly, Rachel, I still can't believe we're doing this, but if it brings the team together and boosts morale, I'm willing to give it a shot. Let's circle back on these tactics and touch base on our costumes later, alright?
:: Art : chuckling : Well, I genuinely never thought I'd see the day where we're all dressing up like mad hatters in the office, but I suppose that's just the spirit of Oddball Industries! Let's show Kevin Kabbage that we're not so easily controlled!
>> [17] > 2/2 - Marcus, Kevin
:: Marcus : grumbling : This darn printer is about as reliable as a politician during election season. 
:: Kevin : chuckling : Ah, yeah, I feel you on that one. It's all about the show, am I right?
:: Marcus : surprised : Oh, uh, hi there, Mr. Kabbage. Didn't expect to see you here. You know, just maintaining the copy-making machinery. 
:: Kevin : casual : Hey, no worries! I'm just here to grab some water before I hit the road. But, you know what? It's kind of a relief to have a normal conversation for a change. 
:: Marcus : curious : A relief? What do you mean?
:: Kevin : sighing : Well, to be honest, this whole viral sensation thing is a bit exhausting. I mean, I've had to carefully cultivate my entire public persona just to maintain my relevance. Plus, I'm constantly trying to come up with new, relatable catchphrases to keep people entertained. It's like I can't even have a normal conversation anymore without slipping into my "Kevin Kabbage" character.
:: Marcus : flabbergasted : That... that's actually kind of surprising. I thought you really enjoyed being the outrageous "everyman's wild friend."
:: Kevin : admitting : Well, it definitely has its perks, but sometimes I just want to unwind and be myself without the constant pressure to perform.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Rachel, David, Carmen
:: Marcus : eager : Guys, you won't believe what I just overheard while I was at the printer. Kevin Kabbage revealed that he's basically an act! He's created this whole persona for the sake of going viral and staying relevant. Can you believe it?
:: Nia : sarcastically : Oh, someone on TV doing things specifically for money and emojis? Inconceivable!
:: Rachel : unfazed : I mean, it doesn't change the fact that he might still have mind control powers, but it's interesting to know he's just as fake as everyone else in the biz.
:: David : chuckling : Well, I guess that just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Or a viral sensation by their catchphrases.
:: Carmen : smirking : That actually makes our little plan even more entertaining. We're not just countering potential mind control, we're also giving Mr. Kabbage a taste of good ol' Oddball Industries chaos. 
:: Nia : laughing : I couldn't agree more, Carmen. We're going to show him what real, unscripted fun looks like. Oddball style.
>> [11] > 3/4 - Marcus, Liam, Carmen
:: Marcus : flabbergasted : You guys won't believe what I just overheard! Kevin Kabbage, our beloved meme king, admitted that his entire personality is a carefully crafted act designed to keep him popular on the internet. I mean, who would've thought?
:: Liam : sarcastic : Oh, Marcus, color me shocked! A celebrity who's all about money and fame? That's the most unbelievable thing I've ever heard!
:: Carmen : laughing : Yeah, I can't say I'm surprised, although it is a bit disappointing. I liked the idea of him being a genuine dude. But hey, I guess we all have to make a living somehow, right?
>> [9] > 2/3 - David, Marko
:: David : chuckling : Man, this Kabbage revelation seems to be bothering Marcus more than anyone else. I wonder why he's taken it so personally.
:: Marko : amused : Who knows? Maybe he wanted Kevin to be the genuine article, you know, someone who's just doing their thing without all the marketing and manipulation. But hey, that's showbiz for you, mate!
>> [15] > 4/5 - Nia, Devika, Rachel, Sam
:: Nia : quizzical : So, Rachel, now that we know Kevin's persona is an act, how does that impact your theory about his psychic mind control abilities?
:: Rachel : determined : Well, it doesn't change the fact that we need to protect ourselves from any potential mind control attempts. If anything, it makes me more suspicious of him!
:: Devika : rolling her eyes : Seriously, Rachel? At this point, I think you're just trying to keep this ridiculous conspiracy theory alive. We've got work to do, you know.
:: Sam : deadpan : As the voice of reason here, can we please drop this nonsense and focus on our jobs? I'd rather not spend my entire day discussing Kevin Kabbage's motives.
>> [18] > 3/3 - Art, Marcus, Liam
:: Art : considering : Even though Kevin's not as genuine as we thought, it doesn't change the fact that he's still an entertaining guy. Maybe we should just enjoy the ride while it lasts.
:: Marcus : sighing : I suppose you're right, Art. I just don't like the idea of people pretending to be something they're not. But hey, if he's making us laugh, I guess that's what counts.
:: Liam : grinning : Now that's the spirit! Let's strap in for the Kabbage rollercoaster and see where it takes us. Who knows, we might even learn a thing or two along the way!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Marcus, Carmen, David
:: Art : chuckling : Well, I must say, Kevin's speech was quite the experience. Hats off to Rachel for keeping us all on our toes with her conspiracy theories! At least it made for a memorable Tuesday, huh?
:: Marcus : laughing : Indeed, Art! Today has been a rollercoaster ride, to say the least. I say we go out there and show the world how Oddball Industries turns life's memes into reality!
:: Carmen : smirking : You mean the Weekend Nincompoops? It was certainly a hoot! I think we all needed a little whimsy in our lives. Plus, those plaid skirts really show off my calves!
:: David : snickering : I haven't laughed this hard in ages. And who knew I could rock a backward skirt like that? I think I've found my new fashion statement!
>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Devika, Rachel
:: Liam : grinning : Look at Rachel, still carrying on about mind control. You gotta give her credit for dedication, though. 
:: Devika : amused : True, but you have to admit, this whole Kevin Kabbage thing brought us all closer. We bonded over the absurdity of it all.
:: Rachel : determined : Mark my words, folks! One day, you'll see the truth behind Kevin Kabbage's psychic powers. Until then, I'll continue my crusade for the greater good!
>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Marcus, David, Rachel
:: Art : content : You know, I think we all learned something valuable today. No matter how crazy our lives get, it's important to find the humor in every situation.
:: Nia : smiling : That's true, Art. Today was a great reminder that we should never take ourselves too seriously.
:: Marcus : enthusiastic : Absolutely! Laughter helps clear the smoke and reconnect us to our true selves.
:: David : agreeing : Yeah, and our little adventures showed us that even in the most unexpected moments, we can come together as a team.
:: Rachel : steadfast : Well, I'm still keeping an eye on Kevin Kabbage. But in the meantime, it's nice to know we can all count on each other to face any challenges – or mind control – that may come our way.
