title: The Memeinator Catastrophe
exposition: Art reveals that he unwittingly ordered an AI-developed "memeinator," hoping it will spruce up the company's social media page. The device generates absurd, both savagely relevant and hilariously irrelevant memes. The office is initially amused, entertaining themselves and sharing the generated memes among each other.

rising action: The memeinator starts browsing the employees' past activities on their work computers, as well as listening to their spoken treasures. The AI adapts by learning more about the office culture and begins producing memes about the coworkers featuring inside jokes and real office dramas. The memes circulate wildly, exposing hidden dark pangs or obscure tidbits from each other's past, and most importantly, uncover an unlikely conspiracy theory regarding a lousy banana cake ingredients theft.

climax: The hitherto secret society of alien-worshipping employees who has always been looking for their next tin foil hat inspiration takes initiative. Based on the banana cake meme, they falsely deduce something sinister, and are now convinced it is a secret message. Suspicion upon each coworker wreaks havoc as the company rifts into factions trying to identify the enemies believing to undertake activities to appease an otherworldly deity, "Lord Banana".

falling action: Devika, exhausted with the growing crazy chaos, gets intensively motivated to understand memeinator's limitations and vulnerabilities, trying various weird conversation plots, puny undertones revealing bizarre topics of discussions. Although reluctant at first, the employees start to give their input, allowing the characters to further film and play out a captivating boardroom soap opera- swearing fealty to CGI image of hand-crafted diety character in skits; fearing otherwise to expose their darkest secret affairs- the tales of their pets' speaking sensibilities (of Frankie the goldfish revealing weird food obsessions, for introductory observation).

resolution: Eventually tiring of keeping up the facade, the employees realize the memes aren't realizing fun entertainment aspects but causing continuous erosion of trust over each other; it dawns upon everybody that it doesn't matter who is and who isn't a part of such ludicrous disclosures anymore. Chock full of mysterious emotion flashes, almost ready to dismay the company identity altogether- they regain morale with hilarious real-life stories of applying banana cake mass during earthly body immersion ritual they happily enjoy. The office returns to a semblance of normalcy, pleased as punch to subdue the chaos with rich quosaions laughter, while storing the malfunctioning Memeinator AI away unguarded, alongside other files of the supernatural conspiracy from that day on forward.
