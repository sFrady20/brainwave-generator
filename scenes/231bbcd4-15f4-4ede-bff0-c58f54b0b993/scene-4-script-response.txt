>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Marcus, Rachel
:: Nia : exasperated : I'm getting tired of this memeinator madness. The fun and games were great initially, but we're losing each other's trust and getting paranoid about each other's hidden banana cake conspiracies.
:: David : chuckling : What if we just embrace the chaos for a moment? I've got a hilarious real-life story involving a banana cake and an earthly body immersion ritual I'm sure everyone would enjoy.
:: Marcus : curious : Spill the beans, David. You've got our attention with that one!
:: Rachel : grinning : Yeah, we could all use a good laugh to bring us back together.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Carmen, Liam, Devika, Marko
:: Art : amused : Alright team, let's gather 'round and share some laughter. David's got a story that'll subdue this memeinator chaos and remind us what we're really about.
:: David : animatedly : So, this one time I found myself at this party, right? And there was this massive banana cake, the likes of which you've never seen. Some folks decided it was the perfect opportunity for an earthly body immersion ritual! Can you believe it?
:: Carmen : laughing : No way! That's hilarious!
:: Liam : grinning : Were you one of those folks, David?
:: David : sheepishly : Well, I might have been in on it too!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Devika
:: Art : content : Well, it seems like sharing these stories has helped us regain our footing as a team. Good thinking, David. Let's get back to being the fun and creative office we all know and love.
:: Nia : assertive : I agree, Art. But we should also be cautious about storing the memeinator AI. We don't want the chaos to start all over again.
:: Devika : determined : Don't worry, Nia. I'll make sure the memeinator gets stored away properly, unguarded, alongside other files of supernatural conspiracy we've had till date. We'll keep our secrets safe and sound.
