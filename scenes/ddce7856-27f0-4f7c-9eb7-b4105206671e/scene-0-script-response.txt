>> [1] > 2/4 - Rachel, Art
:: Rachel : excited : Art, have you seen this absurd internet meme about an alien teaching people how to tie their shoes? It's hilarious! I swear, it's the most random thing I've come across in ages.
:: Art : intrigued : Really? Let me see that, Rachel. Hahaha! Well, that's a good one. You know, I've never been much for internet humor, but this has me hooked! What else have you got?
:: Rachel : delighted : Oh, there's so much more! Look at this one, Art. It's a popular fan theory that claims our office is secretly run by lizard people! They even edited our photos to make us look like reptilian overlords – see, that's you looking very lizardly, and there's me with green scales!

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Rachel
:: Art : chuckling : Hahaha, that's just plain ridiculous, but I love it! You know what, Rachel? I think we could all use a little break from the usual routine, maybe even a meme break. Let's give the rest of the office a chance to enjoy these funny internet shenanigans.
:: Rachel : enthusiastic : Great idea, Art! I'm sure everyone will get a kick out of these memes. It'll be like a humorous little distraction to brighten up our workday!

== Rachel takes it upon herself to introduce Art to the world of memes and popular fan theories. The absurdity and humor of meme culture immediately captivate both of them, resulting in Art suggesting that the rest of the office should also enjoy a break from their regular routine. This sets the stage for the meme-induced fun to spread throughout the office, impacting productivity and sparking spirited exchanges of internet humor.
