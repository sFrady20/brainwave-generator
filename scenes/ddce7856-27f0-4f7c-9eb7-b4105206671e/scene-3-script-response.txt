>> [11] > 2/4 - Art, Liam
:: Art : sighing : Well, Liam, it seems our little meme war got a bit out of hand, don't you think? I had no intention of causing hard feelings, but sometimes things just spiral in ways we don't expect.
:: Liam : chuckling : You're right, Art. I mean, who would've thought we'd end up on an intergalactic meme mission with cat overlords, am I right? But hey, sometimes you just gotta roll with the punches and learn from it. 

>> [2] > 2/2 - David, Marcus
:: David : bemused : So, Marcus, after the great meme feud, I can't help but wonder if we should stick to sharing dad jokes around here. What do you think?
:: Marcus : laughing : You know, David, that might not be such a bad idea. After all, there's nothing quite like a good old-fashioned pun to lighten the mood without causing too much chaos. Let's give it a shot!

>> [4] > 2/3 - Nia, Rachel
:: Nia : sternly : Rachel, I appreciate your enthusiasm for sharing fun and creative content with everyone. However, I think it's important to remember that not all jokes are appropriate for the workplace, and we need to be mindful of how our actions affect others.
:: Rachel : apologetic : You're right, Nia. I'm sorry if I contributed to any discomfort in the office. Lesson learned, and I promise to be more careful moving forward.

>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, David, Marcus
:: Art : thoughtfully : Well, gentlemen, I think it's safe to say our meme war taught us all a valuable lesson in office dynamics. Let's all agree to keep the humor on the lighter side and focus on maintaining a positive work environment.
:: David : nodding : Agreed, Art. We can still have a good laugh, but let's make sure we don't cross any lines.
:: Marcus : smiling : Here's to a more wholesome office humor, and may we never forget the great meme feud of Oddball Industries!

== In this act, Art, Liam, David, Marcus, Nia, and Rachel reflect on the meme feud and recognize the importance of maintaining a respectful work environment. They resolve to balance humor with professionalism and focus on promoting a positive and inclusive atmosphere at the office.
