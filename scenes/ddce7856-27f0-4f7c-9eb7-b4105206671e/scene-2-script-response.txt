>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : chuckling : And did you see this one, Nia? I can't believe how creative people are with these memes! It really brightens up the day, don't you think?
:: Nia : hesitantly : Yeah, Art, but we should be careful with sharing all types of memes. Some can be offensive, and we don't want to create an unwelcoming environment here at the office.
:: Art : dismissively : Oh, come on, Nia. We're all adults here, and a little edgy humor never hurt anyone. Here, check this one out...

:: Marcus : laughing : Seriously guys, have you seen the most recent meme Art shared in the group chat? It's hilarious but also a bit... controversial. I can't believe he went there!
:: David : smirking : It's definitely a bold choice, but you know, laughter can often break the tension and help us bond as a team. But yeah, maybe he went a bit too far this time.
:: Carmen : worried : I think Nia might not be too happy about it, though. She's always been a firm believer in maintaining a respectful and inclusive office environment.
:: Liam : grinning : I wouldn't want to be in Art's shoes when she finds out! Let the office drama begin!

:: Carmen : agreeing : It's true. We should never let humor compromise our mutual respect, and as fun as the meme war was, it's important we prioritize our work relationship above all.
:: Liam : nostalgically : Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. But you're right, guys. We're a team, and we have to stick together and be mindful of our actions.
