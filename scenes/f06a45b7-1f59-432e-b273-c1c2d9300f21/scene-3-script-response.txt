:: Art : remorseful : You're right, Nia. I might have made some reckless decisions and now we need to find a way to stabilize the company again. And I'm sorry about dragging you all into this mess.
:: Liam : sarcastic : Oh, you mean everything we've been doing to try and save our own paychecks wasn't just for fun? What a shocker.
:: David : laughing : Liam, you never fail to throw in a sarcastic remark, even in serious situations like this. But you're not wrong. We've been resorting to all kinds of crazy schemes.
:: Carmen : excited : Remember that time we almost turned the office into a meme-coin mining facility? Good times, good times!
