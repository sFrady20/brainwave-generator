>> [11] > 4/4 - Carmen, David, Marcus, Rachel
:: Carmen : enthusiastic : So, I heard that this whole salary cut situation is because of, get this, Art's attempt to save an endangered species of tree-frogs! Can you believe it?
:: David : chuckling : Oh, that's a good one! I heard it's because he's secretly funding a project to send a monkey to Mars. You know, because why not?
:: Marcus : grinning : You're both way off! I overheard that he's trying to get into the business of creating robotic cats for lonely people.
:: Rachel : laughing : And I thought my idea of him investing in a chocolate fountain company was wild! Alright, guys, we need to get creative with our finances. Any ideas on how to compensate for these salary cuts?

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Devika, Liam
:: Marko : confident : You know what? We should create our own cryptocurrency! We'll call it... Oddcoin! We'll be rich in no time!
:: Devika : sarcastic : Oh, sure. Because that's not the most overused and uninspired idea ever. Let's just create a currency out of thin air and expect everyone to jump on board.
:: Liam : smirking : Well, if we make it wildly successful like that Cryptozoo thing, we can just retire early and forget about these salary cuts entirely! We just need a cute animal mascot.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Nia, Michael, Samantha, Art, Rachel
:: Nia : concerned : I appreciate the enthusiasm, everyone, but let's not forget that we still need to focus on our actual jobs. We can't just ignore our clients while we chase after imaginary digital fortunes.
:: Michael : grinning : You're right, we need to find a balance. Maybe we can start a side hustle selling office-inspired merch? Art's funky ties could be a hit!
:: Samantha : deadpan : Or we could just pool our money together and buy a lottery ticket. Then we can split the winnings when we hit the jackpot.
:: Art : laughing : I must admit, I didn't expect you all to be so creative when faced with adversity. You guys never cease to amaze me. 
:: Rachel : determined : We'll find a way to get through this, Art. After all, we're the Oddball Industries family, and we've dealt with weirder stuff before!
