>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Marcus
:: Marcus : concerned : Art, we've noticed you've been, well, a bit off lately. Your obsession with digital cryptocurrency is kind of becoming unhealthy. I mean, what is this Cryptozoo project anyway?
:: Art : drunkenly : Oh Marcus, my friend! Cryptozoo is a project by Logan Paul, it's the next big thing! Digital crypto creatures, man! I'm telling you, this is where the future's headed! Can't you see the dollar signs?!
:: Marcus : sarcastic : Oh, sure. Because taking financial advice from a YouTuber is always a great idea. Why don't you just tattoo a QR code on your forehead while you're at it?

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : stern : Art, rumor has it that you've poured a significant amount of company funds into this Cryptozoo project. You've got to be kidding me! Our budget can't handle this, it's affecting everyone's salary!
:: Art : defensive : Nia, I'm making a bold move for the company. You gotta take risks to make it big in this digital age, you know? Besides, it's not like it's money down the drain. I'm investing in our future! A future filled with digital crypto creatures, that is.
:: Nia : sarcastic : Well, Art, I hope our future selves can pay their bills with these digital creatures. Because right now, the present us is in a financial mess thanks to your "bold move."

>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Liam, Carmen, Rachel
:: David : nervously : Guys, I don't know about you, but I'm starting to worry about my salary. Art's little Cryptozoo investment is really screwing things up.
:: Liam : exaggerating : Yeah, David. I can't believe it either. I mean, we're all gonna be eating ramen noodles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if this keeps up. Might as well rename the office 'Cryptozoo Central,' right?
:: Carmen : sarcastically : Oh, come on, it can't be that bad. I mean, who doesn't love a good meal of digital crypto creatures? We could have a side of blockchain salad to go with it, right?
:: Rachel : overly-dramatic : I could see it now - Oddball Industries brought to its knees by digital creatures from Logan Paul's fever dream. A tale for the ages, truly.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Devika, Marko, Sam, Mike, Marcus
:: Devika : curious : So, what are we going to do to make up for this loss in company funds? Anyone got creative ideas to bring in some extra cash?
:: Marko : enthusiastically : I have an idea! We could start selling Oddball Industries merchandise! Who wouldn't want a shirt with Art's face surrounded by digital crypto creatures?
:: Sam : deadpan : Great. Just what the world needs, more useless merchandise. How about we stick to our actual jobs and try not to get fired instead?
:: Mike : giggling : Who knew Art's drunken obsession would bring out the entrepreneurs in all of us, huh? What a time to be alive!
:: Marcus : chuckling : Yeah, if we ever go down, at least we'll go down laughing, right? To Oddball Industries! Home of the Cryptozoologists!
