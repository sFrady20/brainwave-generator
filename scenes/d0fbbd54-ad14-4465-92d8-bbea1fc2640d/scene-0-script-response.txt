>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Art, Liam, Carmen
:: Marcus : frantic : Guys, you won't believe this fortune I just got from this cookie! It says, "Beware the ides of tweets, for doom shall arise from the trending of unfortunate memes." Is that not a bit too specific and relevant to us? I can't help but think that our Oddball Industries might be on the brink of something terrible. Should we be worried?
:: Art : surprised : Whoa, whoa, let's not get carried away, Marcus. Fortune cookies are just gimmicks, right? They probably just whipped up a random trending topic and slapped it onto something ominous-sounding to get our attention.
:: Liam : sarcastically : Yeah, I'm sure it's just some sort of inside joke among the fortune cookie writers. You know, like that time they put "You will be crushed by a giant duck today" in one of their cookies, and we all panicked and wore duck-proof helmets for a week.
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, that was a classic! But seriously, Marcus, even if it's not just some joke, what are the odds of this fortune actually coming true? I mean, we've all seen some wild stuff on the internet before, but I haven't heard of any doom-inducing memes yet. 

>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Rachel
:: Nia : concerned : So, I heard about that fortune cookie Marcus found. Do you think there's any truth to it? I mean, it's pretty absurd, but it does seem oddly specific...
:: Rachel : dismissive : Oh, come on, Nia! It's just a ridiculous fortune. Who knows what those fortune cookie writers are thinking? Besides, we've got real work to get done. Let's not get distracted by some silly prediction.

>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, Marcus, Liam, Carmen
:: Art : trying to keep calm : Alright, let's all settle down, everyone. We've got an office to run here. Yes, the fortune cookie is weird, but let's not let it get in the way of our work. Besides, maybe it's just a sign that we should all be more mindful of our online presence.
:: Nia : nodding : I agree with Art. It's important to remember that the internet can be a wild and unpredictable place. So regardless of any fortune cookie predictions, we should always be careful about what memes we share and what trends we engage in.
:: Marcus : still worried : You're both right, but I can't help but feel uneasy. I'm going to stay vigilant, just in case this fortune turns out to be more than just a joke.
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, I'm sure the internet will let us know if impending doom is truly upon us. Just keep an eye on those cat videos, Marcus. They seem to know everything.
:: Carmen : chuckling : Yeah, don't worry, Marcus. We'll all be on the lookout for any meme-induced catastrophes. Now, let's get back to work and leave this fortune cookie madness behind us.

== While having lunch, Marcus shares the fortune cookie's eerie prediction about the team's impending doom, which leads to panic and a frantic return to the office. Despite Art and Nia's attempts to calm everyone down and focus on their work, Marcus, Liam, and Carmen can't help but feel a bit uneasy. They agree to stay vigilant and keep an eye on internet trends, while still trying to get on with their day-to-day tasks.
