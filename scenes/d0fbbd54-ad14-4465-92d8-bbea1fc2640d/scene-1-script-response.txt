>> [11] > 4/4 - Devika, Marko, Carmen, Liam
:: Devika : worried : Has anyone here seen that Twitter trend about the impending doom? I can't stop checking it, and it's making me feel really uneasy. It's like that fortune cookie Marcus got could actually be on to something!
:: Marko : jokingly : Oh, come on Devika, it's probably just a viral meme that's creating a panic for no reason. We've seen it happen before, haven't we? Remember the time everyone freaked out about the world ending in 2012?
:: Carmen : smirking : I must admit, I'm also guilty of checking my phone a little too often today. But you're right Marko, we shouldn't let it get to us too much. We still have work to do, after all. 
:: Liam : half-serious : Although, what if there's some truth to it? What if there's something we've done that's set off a chain reaction of disastrous events? We could be the ones who caused our own demise, and we wouldn't even know it! Maybe we should come up with an escape plan in case things go south?

>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Rachel
:: Nia : concerned : Rachel, have you been noticing the weird vibes in the office today? I can't help but feel that everyone is on edge because of this fortune cookie and Twitter trend nonsense. It's starting to affect productivity.
:: Rachel : gossiping : Oh, Nia! You wouldn't believe what I overheard at the water cooler earlier. Carmen, Liam, and Marcus are actually discussing escape plans in case this catastrophe comes true! Can you imagine? Our very own Oddballs, prepping for the apocalypse triggered by a fortune cookie!

>> [14] > 2/2 - Liam, Marcus
:: Liam : smirking : So, Marcus, now that we know we might be facing impending doom, what's your grand escape plan? I've always wondered how you'd face the end of the world.
:: Marcus : theatrically : Ah, my dear Liam! I shall reveal to you my master plan! I shall gather all the memes, viral tweets, and conspiracy theories in the world and combine them into a magnificent vortex of internet culture. Using this vortex, I'll create a protective shield around us and ride the wave of internet chaos to safety!
:: Liam : laughing : Oh, Marcus! That has to be the most absurd escape plan I've ever heard. But I must admit, it's also the most entertaining!
