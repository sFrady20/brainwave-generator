title: The Memeingful Fortune Cookie
exposition: While the team at Oddball Industries is grabbing lunch one day, Marcus cracks open a fortune cookie that contains an eerily accurate prediction about the team's impending doom. Struck by panic, Marcus frantically shares the news with the team and everyone dashes back to the office.

rising action: The office becomes an eerily quiet space as people keep checking social media feverishly, trying to figure it out if the fortune cookie was based on a recent internet meme, conspiracy theory, or fake news. To none surprise they eventually convince one another that this disastrous event is really about to happen. Instead of logically moving onto important busaniess decisions, they start gossiping on hypothetical escape plans, pointing fingers at who they believe caused the prophesied fate through small actions. 

climax: Art, uncomfortably listening to their conspiracy theories and superstitions, becomes fully drenched in the paranoia. He accidentally spots a Doomsday related Twitter trend and in a horde guidance approach decides to announce this disturbing news during the weekly meeting leaving everyone panicking and abandoning their workplace. 

falling action: Everyone prepares for the apparently imminent, unpredictable catastrophe. But they quickly realize that frantically retweeting about, discussing fails to brings the event to reality.

resolution: Art takes this time to teach everyone, though be cautious about it quirks or coincidences might sometimes just stay as humor or fiction, they can easily cloud someone's mind in everyday problems yet call it a deja-vu lapanopheia or uncommonly coincidence. The Oddball Industries crew dry laughter echo as they see their assumption was a trivial conspiracy, and returns to their jobs, slightly more enthusiastic at the idea of escaping Armaggedonian tweets this afternoon.
