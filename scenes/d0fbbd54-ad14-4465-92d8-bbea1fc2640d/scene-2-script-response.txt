>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Liam, David
:: Art : nervously : You know, I never thought I'd see the day when a fortune cookie takes over the office. The paranoia is so thick, you could cut it with a knife! Have either of you seen that Doomsday Twitter trend? It's unnerving...
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, you mean the one where everyone's supposed to buy 50 gallons of milk and pour it into a kiddie pool to prepare for the end of the world? Yeah, I've seen it. People will believe anything these days, won't they? 
:: David : chuckling : Well, I've heard worse Doomsday scenarios. I mean, who wouldn't want to take a milky bath in the face of Armageddon? Better than panicking, right?

>> [16] > 7/7 - Art, Nia, Rachel, Devika, Marcus, Carmen, Liam
:: Art : pacing : Alright, everyone, I've called this emergency meeting because of the paranoia that's gripped our beloved Oddball Industries. It seems that a fortune cookie and a Twitter trend have us all fearing the worst.
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : Art, do we really need to indulge this hysteria? I mean, it's just a fortune cookie and a silly Twitter trend. We have work to do.
:: Marcus : dramatically : But what if the fortune cookie is right? What if we're trapped in a meme's reality and the end is nigh? I don't want to go down with just a sad trombone sound as my legacy!
:: Devika : sarcastically : Oh, come on! As a developer, I've seen my fair share of fake news and viral hoaxes. This is just another one of those. Can we get back to work now?
:: Rachel : chiming in : But what if it's not a hoax, Devika? What if our collective bad decisions and incompetence have finally come back to haunt us in the form of milk-filled kiddie pools and doom?

>> [11] > 4/4 - Carmen, David, Sam, Marko
:: Carmen : trying to lighten the mood : You know what? If the world is ending, at least we'll go out in a blaze of glory, or you know... with milky skin from that milk bath! I've always wanted to try one of those.
:: David : laughing : Hey, if the milk bath doesn't work, we can always have a pudding party! I've heard that's a great way to bond with your coworkers before the apocalypse.
:: Sam : deadpan : You're all insane. This is a waste of time. Can we please get back to work and stop entertaining this absurdity? 
:: Marko : grinning : Aw, come on, Sam! Loosen up a bit! We're just having a laugh. Anyway, do you even know how hard it is to find a kiddie pool these days? It's not like we'll all be doing it anyway.

== In this act, Art, having been affected by the paranoia, calls an emergency meeting regarding the fortune cookie prediction and the "Doomsday Twitter trend." Characters question the validity of the fortune cookie and the Twitter trend, with some being more serious than others. Humorous alternatives are suggested, such as milk baths and pudding parties, but in the end, they all acknowledge the absurdity of the situation and express their desire to return to work. The act is filled with ridiculous banter, edgy humor, and internet references, emphasizing the wacky nature of the characters and how easily they can be drawn into outlandish scenarios.
