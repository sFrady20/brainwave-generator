>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Carmen, David
:: Art : exasperated : You know, it really shouldn't take a fortune cookie and an internet trend to remind us that sometimes, we let our fears and imagination run a bit wild. Haven't any of y'all heard of deja-vu lapanopheia or uncommon coincidences? Just because something seems like a dreadful omen, doesn't mean it's actually true!
:: Carmen : chuckling : You know, Art, you're right. I think we all got a little too wrapped up in the drama of it all. I mean, who hasn't felt a little bit like the world is ending when they see some crazy meme or conspiracy theory online? But, we should have known better.
:: David : laughing : I've got to admit, I was pretty convinced for a minute there that we were all doomed. But, I guess the internet has a way of making everything seem more dramatic than it really is. We should probably get back to work now and focus on what really matters – like making sure we don't accidentally trip over anything in the office!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Marcus, Rachel, Liam
:: Nia : amused : Well, that was quite the wild ride! But, let's take this as a lesson to not let internet trends and superstitions distract us from our actual work. We have goals to achieve and clients to satisfy, and we can't let ourselves be influenced by every little thing we see online.
:: Marcus : nodding : Absolutely, Nia. And if I may add, this experience has shown us that a little bit of humor and laughter can go a long way in easing tension in the office. After all, laughter is the best medicine, right?
:: Rachel : giggling : That's true, Marcus! I think we all needed a good laugh today. I just hope we can keep our cool the next time the internet throws a curveball our way.
:: Liam : smirking : Yeah, but let's be honest. With the way things are going, we'll probably have another internet crisis on our hands before lunchtime tomorrow.

>> [16] > 5/7 - Devika, Marko, Sam, Mike, Art
:: Devika : relieved : I'm glad we can finally put this whole fortune cookie debacle behind us and get back to our work. Honestly, we should have known better than to take it so seriously.
:: Marko : grinning : You're right, Devika. But you know what they say, "A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men." Or, in our case, the Oddball Industries crew!
:: Sam : sarcastic : Oh, great! A new motto for us! I'll be sure to remember that the next time we're huddling in fear over some internet trend.
:: Mike : chuckling : Come on, Sam. Lighten up. It's not every day we get to experience the end of the world, even if it's just in our heads.
:: Art : content : That's the spirit, everyone! Now, let's get back to work and make the most of this Armageddon-free afternoon, shall we?

== In this act, Art teaches the crew a lesson about not letting internet trends and superstitions distract them from their work. The characters all have a good laugh, acknowledging the absurdity of the situation and how they got carried away with the fortune cookie and Doomsday Twitter trend. The act is filled with edgy jokes, irreverent banter, and amusing interplay between the characters as they return to their jobs, slightly more enthusiastic about their Armageddon-free afternoon.
