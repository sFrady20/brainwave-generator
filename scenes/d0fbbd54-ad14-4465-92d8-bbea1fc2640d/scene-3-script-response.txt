>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Art, David, Liam
:: Marcus : exaggerated : I've bought all the canned food I could get my hands on, enough to last us for months! We need to be ready for anything!
:: Art : sarcasm : Oh, Marcus... I'm sure we'll survive the great Twitter Doomsday just fine with all these cans of beans and corn.
:: David : chuckling : So, did you manage to stock up on any pudding, Marcus? It's essential for our survival, you know.
:: Liam : feigning panic : Don't forget the milk baths! We can't endure this catastrophe without proper self-care!

>> [15] > 5/5 - Carmen, Nia, Rachel, Devika, Marko
:: Carmen : in disbelief : I can't believe we're actually entertaining the idea of a meme-inspired Armageddon...
:: Nia : sternly : Everyone, we need to get a grip and stop feeding into this madness. We have work to do!
:: Rachel : lightheartedly : You know, I heard cat videos can ward off bad luck, maybe we should try that?
:: Devika : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely! Let's watch fluffy kittens instead of working. That'll save Oddball Industries!
:: Marko : grinning : Well, at least it'll give us a good laugh before we meet our doom, right?

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Samantha
:: Devika : sighing : I never thought I'd see the day when everyone loses their minds over a tweet.
:: Samantha : seriously : We need to stay focused and not let this nonsense affect our work.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, David
:: Nia : frustrated : We had a whole day wasted on this paranoia. We need to accept in the end, it's just a fortune cookie and a silly tweet!
:: Rachel : relieved : You're right, Nia. We should all just get back to work and forget about this madness.
:: David : chuckling : I'm just glad I didn't invest in that bunker somebody was selling online.
