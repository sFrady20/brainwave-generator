>> [16] > 7/7 - Nia, Art, Carmen, Marcus, David, Liam, Devika
:: Nia : dramatically : Ladies and gentlemen, behold the secret to obtaining ultimate productivity, success, and fulfillment in our work lives: the hive mind theory! I present to you today, our very own Oddball Industries Bee Colony!
:: Art : proudly : I always knew this day would come, Nia. We shall transform ourselves into a thriving, buzzing, highly productive workforce. Remember everyone, think like a bee, work like a bee, and you'll reap the sweet rewards of honey!
:: Carmen : excitedly : I brought a little surprise to help with visual aids! *rummages through handbag, accidentally releases live bees* Uh-oh... I didn't mean for that to happen!
:: Marcus : panicking : Carmen, are you insane? Bees! Real bees! This is not what we signed up for!
:: David : delighted : Buzz buzz, my fellow colleagues! Looks like we've got some stinging competition in the office! I guess this presentation just got a whole lot... bee-utiful!
:: Liam : nervously : I'm not usually scared of bees, but this is beyond ridiculous, even for Oddball Industries standards.
:: Devika : annoyed : It was funny at first, but we've clearly taken it too far. I can't focus on my work with bees flying around!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Art, Rachel
:: Nia : exasperated : Alright, Art, we need to call it quits on the hive mind experiment. This has just gone too far!
:: Art : reluctantly : I suppose you're right, Nia. I never intended for it to get this out of hand. 
:: Rachel : sarcastically : Well, at least we had a good laugh, and isn't that what truly matters in the end?
