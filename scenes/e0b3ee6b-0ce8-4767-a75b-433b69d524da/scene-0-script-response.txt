>> [22] > 2/3 - Nia, Art
:: Nia : enthusiastic : So, team, I've been reading this book on productivity, and it suggests that we should start each day with a "morning huddle." It's a brief gathering where we can share our goals for the day and any updates. What do you think?
:: Art : intrigued : A morning huddle? Hmmm, you know that reminds me of something I read recently about bees. Fascinating creatures! They work together in a hive and are so efficient that they can accomplish seemingly impossible tasks. Maybe we can learn something from them.

>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Liam
:: Art : excited : Liam, did you know that bees have this incredible communication system? They do this wiggle dance to share the location of food sources with the rest of the hive. It's like a perfectly choreographed ballet in the insect world! Isn't that amazing? Maybe we should give it a try!
:: Liam : amused : You know, Art, if you're so keen on this bee thing, why not give beekeeping a go? I've heard it's quite the buzz these days. Plus, who wouldn't want an endless source of honey?
 
>> [22] > 3/3 - Nia, Marcus, David
:: Nia : sarcastic : Great, now Art's going to turn this place into a hive. I can't wait to see what our clients think when we start buzzing in their ears during meetings.
:: Marcus : chuckling : Well, Nia, you know what they say: "The bee's knees are the highest form of flattery!" Or at least, that's what I'll pretend they say. Who knows, maybe this hive mind thing will turn us into a well-oiled machine.
:: David : grinning : Oh, bee-have, you guys! I'm just buzzing with excitement over this new strategy – I mean, seriously, it's like we're all gonna become worker bees, amirite? Let's all put on our bee caps and start wiggling around! 

== In this act, Nia introduces the concept of a "morning huddle" to the team, but Art gets fascinated by the idea of beekeeping instead. He excitedly shares his newfound knowledge about bees with the rest of the team, who humor him with witty banter and jokes. The gang chalks it up as another one of Art's out-of-the-ordinary antics that they've come to expect at Oddball Industries.
