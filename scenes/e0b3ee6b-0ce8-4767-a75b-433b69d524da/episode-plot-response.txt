title: The Hive Mind Mystery
exposition: When Nia introduces the concept of a "morning huddle" as a strategy to boost productivity, Art unexpectedly becomes interested in beekeeping and shares a unique theory about how bees hold the key to unlocking infinite success. The gang humor him, chalking it up to Art's out-of-the-ordinary antics typical for a Wednesday afternoon.

rising action: As the absurd theory seizes the company, everyone starts acting like busy bees - communicating through awkward buzzing sounds, referring to established hierarchies related to colonies, and consuming honey like it's being taken out of production. The employees bind together in pursuit of the so-called "hive mind" to become more productive.

climax: During the "queen bee" presentation (an assignment Art unironically vests in Nia), Carmen releases bees from her handbag as a visual aid gone wrong, leading to unexpected chaos. Some react lightheartedly, others inadvertently display their fear of bees, and pun-teller David is convinced his career just got sweeter by tenfold, fuelled with bee-focused word plays. Mayhem ensues.

falling action: Eventually, when Marcus is forced to scrub honey off his prized silk shirt, fed up comments from employees circulate regarding pointless meetings and overzealous bee behavior. Maybe morphing into bees isn't such a good idea after all.

resolution: Empathetic Art sheepishly admits that office whimsies aren't always a buzzing success. The group descends into laughter, recalling bits and pieces of their vent-session like the persistent pollen stain in the break room. With the hive mind trope launched out the window and exhaustion settling in, Oddball Industries staggers merrily back onto normal business ground, because nobody can keep a bee imitation going forever.
