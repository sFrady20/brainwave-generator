>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Art : sheepish : Well folks, I guess it's safe to say that our stint as bees wasn't exactly the great productivity booster I thought it would be. But hey, we had some laughs, right?
:: Nia : chuckling : Art, you certainly know how to keep things interesting around here. Let's just stick to good ol' human communication from now on, shall we?
:: David : grinning : I agree, but I'll admit I'm going to miss some of the bee-haviors we picked up. I was really starting to enjoy the daily honey breaks!
:: Carmen : laughing : David, I swear if I hear one more bee pun from you, I'm going to lose it!
:: Marcus : dramatic : My dear friends, let us not forget the tragic loss of my beloved silk shirt, a casualty of our hive-minded adventure. But fear not, for I shall find solace in the sweet memories of our chaotic, bee-ridden office!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Art, Nia, David, Marcus
:: David : smirking : So, now that we're back to being mere mortals, shall we address the pollen stain in the break room?
:: Nia : rolling eyes : Yes, David, we'll get the break room back to normal. But let's not forget about the actual work we have to do around here.
:: Art : enthusiastic : Agreed, Nia! It's time we get back to business as usual. But let's also remember the fun and unity we found while buzzing around together.
:: Marcus : reflective : You're right, Art. Even though our bee escapades were ultimately short-lived, they did bring us closer together. And that's something worth cherishing.

== In this act, Art acknowledges the absurdity and failure of their beekeeping experiment. The employees, Nia, David, Carmen, and Marcus, share some final jokes and laughter about the bizarre experience, bringing a sense of unity and camaraderie to the office. They then agree to return to normalcy and focus on their actual work responsibilities, with a newfound appreciation for the bond they share after their brief adventure as bees.
