>> [15] > 5/5 - Art, Nia, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Art : excited : You know what, team? Bees are amazing creatures! They've got this incredible hive mind that we should adopt here at Oddball Industries. Can you imagine the kind of productivity we could achieve if we all communicate like bees and tap into that collective mindset?
:: Nia : skeptical : Art, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but how exactly do you propose we adopt the communication methods of bees in the workplace?
:: David : snickering : Yeah, should we start buzzing around the office and doing a little waggle dance whenever we have an idea? 
:: Carmen : giggling : I'm all for it! As long as we can have honey breaks instead of coffee breaks.
:: Marcus : amused : Indeed, we could also establish a queen bee to make all the decisions! I nominate Nia for the role. All hail Queen Nia!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Rachel, Devika, Marko
:: Liam : buzzing : Bzz bzz, hive mates! I got an amazing sale lead we should swarm on.
:: Rachel : chuckling : Liam, are you seriously buzzing? 
:: Devika : sarcastically : Hey, if the hive mind theory helps us work better as a team, I'm all for it. Buzz buzz!
:: Marko : grinning : I never thought I'd say this, but I'm dreading Art's next off-the-wall idea. Still, let's see how long we can keep this bee charade going.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Nia, Marcus, Sam
:: Nia : exasperated : I can't believe everyone is taking this bee thing so seriously! I'm practically drowning in honey over here.
:: Marcus : gleefully : But, Queen Nia, your loyal subjects are only trying to create the perfect hive for Oddball Industries!
:: Sam : deadpan : If I see one more person doing a waggle dance in the hallway, I might lose it.
== The employees humor Art's bee theory and start communicating through buzzing sounds and adopting bee-like behaviors. They joke around with each other, as each character adds their unique flavor to the situation. They all take on bee-related roles, such as Nia being the queen bee, and engage in ridiculous antics like waggle dances and buzzing. However, as the act progresses, they start to realize that the joke has gone too far, and the characters begin to dread Art's next bizarre idea. The act concludes with anticipation for the inevitable crash when the hive mind experiment runs its course.
