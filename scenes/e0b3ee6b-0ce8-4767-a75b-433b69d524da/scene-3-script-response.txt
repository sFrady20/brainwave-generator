>> [13] > 2/3 - Carmen, Marcus
:: Carmen : concerned : Marcus, I can't help but feel guilty that my little bee prank has led to a mess of honey and chaos. How's the honey removal from your silk shirt coming along?
:: Marcus : exasperated : Carmen, my dear fashion saboteur, I do believe I've reached a point where I must accept that this shirt is lost to the honey-soaked realm of ruined wardrobe. It's a testament to our misguided attempt at emulating bees.
:: Carmen : apologetic : I'm really sorry, Marcus. I should've known better than to let loose live bees during the presentation. Let's be honest, we're all a bit cuckoo for even entertaining the idea of becoming human bees in the first place.
:: Marcus : chuckling : Well, we certainly buzzed our way through this hive mind escapade, didn't we? I must say, though, it's been a rather peculiar journey of self-discovery. Turns out, I absolutely can't stand being covered in sticky substances.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Art, Devika
:: Nia : chuckling : I can't believe we all thought that acting like bees would somehow make us more productive. It's just another one of those typical Oddballs adventures, right?
:: David : amused : You could say we've really been... buzzing with excitement. But I think we can all agree, it's time to put this hive-minded episode behind us.
:: Art : contemplative : You're right, David. It's important to remember that we're not bees, and we shouldn't try to function like them. Perhaps it's time we got back to our human ways and focused on actual, meaningful work.
:: Devika : relieved : I'm glad we're ending this experiment. It was fun while it lasted, but I just can't bear to hear any more bee puns from David. Also, I have spent far too much time researching bee species instead of coding.

== In this act, Marcus laments the loss of his silk shirt due to the honey mishap, and Carmen apologizes for the chaos caused during the presentation. The employees, including Nia, David, Art, and Devika, gather and acknowledge the absurdity of their hive mind experiment, agreeing it is time to return to normalcy. They share jokes and laughter about the bizarre experience, while also making a conscious effort to move past the bee-related shenanigans and focus on actual work, bringing a sense of unity and camaraderie to the office.
