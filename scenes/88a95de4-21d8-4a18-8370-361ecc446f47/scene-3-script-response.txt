>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Carmen, David, Devika
:: Marcus : baffled : Can you believe how out of hand things have gotten? It's pandemonium! I mean, we all enjoyed the bizarre bazaar, but who knew the sentient mug would cause such chaos?
:: Carmen : chuckling : I know, right?! I mean, I thought my collection of stapler history was pretty wild, but Liam's Pepe-hair Donut obsession takes the cake... or should I say, the donut?
:: David : laughing : You're both right, but hey, at least we're dealing with cacti and not an office full of angry bees or something, am I right? Although, I do miss our little secret trading ring; it was a fun distraction.
:: Devika : thoughtfully : It's true, our bizarre little bazaar brought some excitement to the office, but maybe we should consider finding a new way to bond, one that doesn't involve sentient mugs or poisonous cacti. 

>> [9] > 3/3 - Liam, Art, Mike
:: Liam : panicked : Art, I didn't mean for all of this to happen. The Pepe-hair Donut, the sentient mug... it was all just supposed to be a bit of fun. I never thought the consequences would escalate.
:: Art : soothing : Calm down, Liam. Strange things happen at Oddball Industries. It's practically our motto. We'll just have to solve this problem together, like the big dysfunctional family we are.
:: Mike : nodding : Art's right. We can't dwell on what's already been done. Instead, we need to focus on cleaning up the mess and figuring out how to move forward without letting something like this happen again.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Rachel, Nia, Marko
:: Rachel : concerned : So, what do we do now? The entire office is practically overrun with these weird cacti, and it doesn't seem like a problem we can just sweep under the rug.
:: Nia : determined : We face it head-on, Rachel. We'll figure out a plan to rid the office of these hazardous plants and make sure nothing like this ever happens again. It's time for us to come together and find a solution.
:: Marko : joking : Well, at least we can say one thing for sure - we've definitely learned our lesson about trading bizarre items in secret office bazaars! I mean, who'd have thought a sentient mug would lead to this?

== In this act, the employees are coming together to address the chaos caused by the secret office bazaar.
