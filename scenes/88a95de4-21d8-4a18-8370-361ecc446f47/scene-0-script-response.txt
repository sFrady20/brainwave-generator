>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : excitedly : Nia, I think I just stumbled across a goldmine! I found this secret chatroom hidden in the company files where everyone's trading the weirdest things! There's meme templates, bizarre office artifacts, and even skill trades. It's all so strange and fascinating!
:: Nia : baffled : Art, that sounds...interesting. But shouldn't we be focusing on work instead of getting caught up in this odd market? I mean, it's hilarious, but it might be a distraction.
:: Art : dismissively : Nia, Nia, Nia. We need to let our employees blow off some steam! It's all in good fun. I'm even thinking about joining in on the action. How about trading my ability to balance a pencil on my nose for that cat meme generator?

>> [11] > 3/4 - Rachel, David, Devika
:: Rachel : gossiping : Guys, have you heard about the secret chatroom where everyone's trading random stuff? Apparently, Art himself is getting in on it!
:: David : snickering : What? For real? I've always wanted to trade my collection of weird staplers. I bet I could get a fortune in spaghetti dinners for them!
:: Devika : intrigued : You know, I've got some out-of-the-box ideas that I'd love to trade. Maybe I'll finally find someone who appreciates my unconventional thinking.

>> [15] > 4/5 - Carmen, Marcus, Liam, Samantha
:: Carmen : laughing : So, what's the craziest thing you guys have seen on the secret chat?
:: Marcus : smirking : Well, I saw someone offering an interdimensional portal opener. I don't know if it's real, but it's certainly entertaining.
:: Liam : excitedly : I saw a Pepe-hair Donut being auctioned off! I'm desperate to have it. I'm even willing to trade this sentient insult-mug I found in the sales department.
:: Samantha : unamused : You all need to get a grip. This whole thing is absurd, and I can't believe you're all wasting your time on it.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Art, Nia, Rachel
:: Art : proudly : Good news, everyone! The secret chatroom is now officially sanctioned by management. Let the bizarre bidding wars begin!
:: Nia : reluctantly : Well, if it's really happening, I guess I can trade my fitness program for a custom-made company mascot plushie. You know, for team-building purposes...
:: Rachel : eagerly : This is going to be so much fun! I wonder if I can trade my gossip skills for something even more intriguing?
