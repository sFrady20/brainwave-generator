title: Art's Bizarre Bazaar
exposition: In this episode, Art discovers an underground black market in a secret employee-operated chatroom concealed within the company files, where employees are bidding on rare, mysterious, and downright strange items with their own forms of non-currency, such as company-made meme templates, weird office artifacts, and obscure skill trades. This phenomenon fascinates Art so much that he decides to participate in the chat himself but it unintentionally leads to total office chaos.

rising action: As part of the auction game, employees scour the office for various bizarre personal items to trade, making things crazier than ever. They start attempting to value those possessions through bizarre calculations that result in funny disasters and unexpected truths coming to light, particularly about Marcus's illegal collection of strange items from other dimensions that are quite amusing but suspicious. This can lead to viral one-liners like David blurting out "My collection of company staplers is worth a fortune in spaghetti dinners!". 

climax: Why not dip into internet meme culture at the heart of it all when Liam spots a Pepe-hair Donut being offered on the bazaar and becomes absolutely desperate to possess it. He bets what might be a sentient mug that only says insults from the sales department without double-checking where that mug collects its material. Consequently, there's a rise in hushed top-secret talks amidst the spicy plot but this mistake causes a questionably mysterious poisonous potted-cactus outbreak in the entire office building unchecked.

falling action: Employees are scrambling to undo their accident while individually dealing with the artifact incident by sharing humorous exchanges, mourning the loss of their in-office bizarre bazaar over the chaos it created. At the same time, Art trials and tribulations of subtly handling conspiracists with his expressive wit leads to various odd one-to-one humorous conversations around the bizarre turns of events that gives a tone of somewhat disbelief.

resolution: In the end, the office chat realizes they must let go of unnecessary material wealth a whirlpool of disastrously hilarious employee showdowns takes backstage helping achieve logistical goals flawlessly due to the staff honed at management in face of war-like absurdities (Liam, for example, enthusiastically develops a market that sells meetings). They agree to dismantle their virtual chat trading space in favor of weekly off-timed office banterings with no location specificity bursting cultural and questionable science discoveries (nutrition and extraterrestrial fans abound) appreciated on sleep in bean bags. Marcus reluctantly discloses secrets to approaching exotic macro issues (milestones). They've managed to catch up on tips/resources they've huddled together, learn happy lessons when time callous teamwork blooms zealous improvements swearing by innovative lifes while love-sigh for outering universally. A catchphrase could be used in this episode, like "We don't have worms growing out of paper trolleys induced by never-talking food. Digression aside, life needed livening up guys!".
