>> [18] > 2/3 - Liam, Marcus
:: Liam : excited : Marcus, you won't believe what I just saw on the bazaar! A Pepe-hair Donut! I mean, that thing's gotta be one of a kind, right? I absolutely need to have it! How could I resist? It's like the holy grail of meme culture!
:: Marcus : laughing : Oh Liam, you and your obsessions! But you're right, it does sound like a unique find. What are you planning on offering for it?
:: Liam : pondering : Well, I was thinking of betting this sentient mug that spews out insults from the sales department. It'll be a hoot, plus it'll give them a taste of their own medicine!
:: Marcus : amused : That's a risky move, buddy, but it might just pay off. Just be careful with that mug, you never know where those insults come from.

>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Carmen, Devika
:: Nia : concerned : Have you guys noticed anything strange going on lately? There's been an awful lot of hushed conversations and people acting suspiciously.
:: Carmen : smirking : Oh Nia, you worry too much! It's just people trading for that Pepe-hair Donut on the office bazaar. You know how people get when it comes to rare finds.
:: Devika : alarmed : Speaking of strange, did you hear about the poisonous potted-cactus outbreak happening in the office? It's like they're multiplying everywhere!
:: Nia : alarmed : What?! No, I haven't heard about that! This is getting out of hand. We need to find a way to put an end to all this chaos.

>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, David, Rachel
:: Marko : curious : What do you guys think about all these cacti popping up? They're starting to get in the way of my work.
:: David : scratching his head : I'm not sure, but I think it might have something to do with Liam's bet for that Pepe-hair Donut. The sentient mug he put up for trade might have something to do with it.
:: Rachel : gasping : That mug! I heard it muttering something about "revenge" earlier today! I think it's causing the cactus outbreak!
:: Marko : shocked : Wait, seriously? This is getting way out of hand. We'll need to figure out how to get rid of these cacti and put a stop to the mug's vengeance!
