>> [17] > 2/2 - David, Marcus
:: David : rambling : You know, Marcus, I've been doing some serious calculations. With this in-office bizarre bazaar, my office staplers will be worth a fortune...in spaghetti dinners! What do you reckon about that, mate?
:: Marcus : amused : Oh, David! I can't even begin to imagine how you arrived at that conclusion. But hey, if it works for you, then who am I to question the value of spaghetti dinners? In fact, I've got a whole collection of strange items from other dimensions that might be quite tempting for people.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Liam, Rachel, Carmen
:: Nia : intrigued : So, anyone found any bizarre treasures to trade?
:: Liam : excited : Oh, Nia! I found this absolutely rare...Pepe-hair donut! I'm putting it up for bid. I'm sure it's going to be priceless in this bizarre bazaar.
:: Rachel : curious : I don't even want to know what that's made of, but at the same time, I'm strangely intrigued.
:: Carmen : jokingly : You know what they say, one Oddball's trash is another Oddball's treasure! I found this paperclip sculpture that looks eerily like Art. I mean, who wouldn't want that gem?

>> [5] > 3/3 - Devika, Samantha, Art
:: Devika : sarcastically : So, do you think my ability to mimic anyone's voice in the office will be worth anything in this bazaar?
:: Samantha : grinning : Oh, that's definitely a skill worth trading, Devika! But let's not forget my incredible talent for making coffee with the perfect amount of foam, every single time.
:: Art : chuckling : Well, you two have certainly tapped into some niche talents! I'm still on the hunt for something to contribute myself. But I'm sure I'll find something...bizarre.

>> [1] > 4/4 - Rachel, Carmen, Nia, Liam
:: Rachel : dramatically : Behold, my Oddball brethren! I present to you, the legendary pen that always runs out of ink right when you need it the most!
:: Carmen : laughing : That's spectacular, Rachel! It's like a cruel joke played by the universe.
:: Nia : smirking : I swear I've had a few of those pens myself. Quite the valuable find, Rachel!
:: Liam : joking : If only we could trade in our bad luck, we'd all be rich in spaghetti dinners!
