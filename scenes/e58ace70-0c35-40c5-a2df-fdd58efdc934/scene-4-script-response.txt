>> [18] > 3/3 - David, Rachel, Marcus
:: David : panting : Well, that was definitely an experience I never thought I'd have. Escaping the crazy dream world of Art? Life at Oddball Industries never ceases to amaze me! So, what's the plan now, dreamwalkers? Shall we swear off any future subconscious explorations?
:: Rachel : nervously : Yeah, I think I've had enough of dream diving for one day, or even for my entire life! We should just keep this a secret and never venture into this again. That was way too intense and chaotic even for my taste!
:: Marcus : dramatically : Agreed! We shall never speak of this harrowing journey again. Let the dreams of our coworkers remain their own, and may we never again be haunted by the ghostly kittens and phantom conference calls that lurk within the twisted realm of Sub-Art Level III.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Carmen, Mike, Devika
:: Nia : suspicious : So, you guys look like you've just been through something intense. Care to share? Or is this some secret club that we're not cool enough to join?
:: Carmen : chuckling : Oh, nothing much, just a little adventure we won't be repeating anytime soon. Right, guys?
:: Mike : trying to act casual : Absolutely, just a little team-building exercise that went a bit off the rails. Nothing to worry about!
:: Devika : smirking : Well, whatever it was, I feel like I've missed out on something epic. But I'll leave it at that, as long as our office remains cat-ghost free!

>> [15] > 3/5 - Liam, Rachel, Marcus
:: Liam : curious : So, was the whole dream exploration thing as incredible as it sounds? Or more of a nightmare you never want to repeat?
:: Rachel : hesitating : Well, let's just say it was a one-time experience that we won't be pursuing again. The depths of Art's subconscious were... um, a bit too wild for our taste.
:: Marcus : agreeing : Indeed, my friend. We've decided to stick to the more mundane world of waking reality from now on. No more venturing into the unknown depths of the human mind for us!
