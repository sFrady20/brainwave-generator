>> [20] > 2/6 - Mike, David
:: Mike : excited : Dude, David, check what I just found! It's a floppy disk, like from the Stone Age of computing! It says it's got some old sleep study software developed by Art's dad. Can you imagine what kind of wild dreams Art has? I bet it'd be like some sort of Kafkaesque daycare center!
:: David : interested : Haha, yeah, or maybe his dreams are full of ever-moving receptionist desks mobbed by cats. You know, just the typical late-night cartoon chaos we all dream of.
:: Mike : musing : What if we could use this program to mess around in Art's dreams? You know, like that movie with the dream hackers, Randall's Raiders?
:: David : laughing : That would be absolutely bonkers, man! We could create some false office rivalries and disguise them as "friendly competition." Imagine Art waking up thinking he's stuck in a phantom conference call!

>> [11] > 4/4 - Mike, David, Rachel, Marcus
:: Rachel : smirking : Hey guys, what's this I hear about Art's dreams and friendly competition? Are we planning something diabolical?
:: David : grinning : Oh, nothing too crazy, just thinking about taking a little trip into Art's dreams to stir up some chaos.
:: Marcus : intrigued : Well, count me in! I'm always up for a bit of mischief, especially if it involves infiltrating the boss's dreams!
:: Mike : pumped : Great, then it's settled! We'll form our own little Randall's Raiders and prepare for some hilarious psychic pranks.

>> [19] > 1/3 - Art
:: Art : to himself : If only they knew the dangers of diving too deep into someone's subconscious. The mind is a fragile place, especially for an old-timer like me. But I suppose it's their choice if they want to risk it all for a bit of a laugh... and who am I to stop them?

>> [18] > 3/3 - Mike, David, Carmen
:: Carmen : excited : Alright, so now that we've got our team assembled, how do we actually get into Art's dreams without getting caught?
:: David : scheming : I think I have an idea. We could use that program Mike found to project Art's dreams onto a green screen and then we could just stroll right in.
:: Mike : amazed : That's genius, David! We'll have to be careful not to go too deep into his subconscious though, or we could run into some serious trouble.

== In this act, Mike accidentally discovers a floppy disk with a program developed by Art's father during sleep studies, and the team decides to form their makeshift version of Randall's Raiders using that program. They aim to use their newly discovered power to pull off psychic pranks on their coworkers, like creating false office rivalries disguised as "friendly competition." The team discusses their plans in various locations around the office, while Art, unbeknownst to the team, is aware of their intentions and chooses not to intervene. The act concludes with the team preparing to infiltrate Art's dreams.
