title: Oddception
exposition: In the world of corporate espionage, a skilled team of mental hackers called "Randall's Raiders" are famous for infiltrating the depths of people's subconscious to steal and manipulate their ideas. However, Mike accidentally discovers a floppy disk with a program developed by Art's father during sleep studies, rendering the key to crack into people's dreams.

rising action: Realizing the potential hilariousness and chaos that could ensue, Mike shares this news with David, Rachel, Marcus, and Carmen as they decide to form their makeshift version of Randall's Raiders. They aim to use their newly discovered power to pull pranks on their coworkers like creating false office rivalries disguised as "friendly competition."

climax: After infiltrating Art's dreams, they are chased through a myriad of bizarre dreamscapes right out of a Kafkaesque daycare center. From ever-moving receptionist desks mobbed by cats to spooky phantom conference calls, they become trapped in a mind-bending office environment plagued by fantastical office dwellers.

falling action: They soon learn that plunging too deep into someone's subconscious, especially seniors like Art, can be dangerous - causing to the team member's fragile da Vinci-esque cubicle city to cascade into chaos upon descent into Sub-Art level III. While they start to second-guess how detailed the raider-employees' backgrounds are, they realize this mission can go one of two ways: comedy gold or permanently jumbled up coworkers turned decaying corporate constructs (Juggernaut Office Version of the Office Still At Work, Circa 1994 Edition).

resolution: The newfound dreamwalkers battle their way clumsily out of chaotic profundity delusions of Art to return to the relative sanity of their real-life office twosome dance-groups, vowing never to push the boundaries of late-night cartoon series animated plotlines with a single corporate incursion never again left untold. The team hesitantly reassembles the well-coincided member-resource relationship after intrusions mild in illusion but acid in management circles.
