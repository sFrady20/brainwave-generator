>> [15] > 5/5 - Mike, David, Rachel, Marcus, Carmen
:: Mike : exaggerated : Alright, team! We've descended deep into the chaotic realm of Art's subconscious. This is Sub-Art Level III, the mysterious zone where an army of fax machines and floppy disks roam free!
:: David : sarcastically : Oh, wonderful! I feel like I'm in a surreal time capsule, surrounded by relics from a bygone era. I wonder if we'll find a VHS tape of Art's favorite sitcom next?
:: Carmen : jokingly : Or better yet, an old dial-up modem screeching in agony as it tries to connect to the Internet!
:: Marcus : uneasily : On a serious note, though, is anyone else getting the vibe that this place might be more dangerous than we initially thought? I mean, there's a twisted file cabinet over there that kind of looks like it's out for blood...
:: Rachel : worried : Yeah, I definitely didn't sign up for this when I agreed to join the dream team. The deeper we go into Art's subconscious, the more I feel like we're tempting fate.

>> [16] > 3/7 - Mike, David, Rachel
:: Mike : concerned : We should probably get out of here soon. Let's see if we can find a way back up to the surface before we wind up as permanent residents of this nightmare office.
:: David : chuckling : Agreed! I don't want to end up as an eternal employee of the Juggernaut Office, working on a never-ending backlog of TPS reports from 1994.
:: Rachel : nervously : Okay, you two, let's stay focused. We need to find an exit and remember: teamwork makes the dream work... or in this case, helps us escape the dream!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, Carmen, Mike
:: Marcus : frantic : Guys, look! A door labeled "EXIT" just appeared out of nowhere! This has to be our ticket out of here, right?
:: Carmen : suspicious : It seems too easy. Are you sure it's not another one of Art's subconscious traps?
:: Mike : determined :  There's only one way to find out. Let's open the door and hope for the best. It's either this or becoming a permanent part of Art's twisted subconscious.
