>> [18] > 3/3 - Mike, David, Rachel
:: Mike : excited : You guys won't believe what I found! It's a floppy disk with a program developed by Art's dad. It's like some kind of dream hacking thing.
:: David : intrigued : Dream hacking? That sounds like some serious sci-fi stuff right there! So, what can we do with this newfound power, oh fearless leader?
:: Rachel : sarcastic : Oh great, just what we needed. The ability to mess with our coworkers' heads in a whole new way. What's the plan? Make everyone think they're a superhero or something?

>> [11] > 4/4 - Mike, Marcus, Carmen
:: Mike : smirking : Well, I was thinking of something more subtle, like creating false office rivalries disguised as "friendly competition" to spice things up around here.
:: Marcus : laughing : That's a brilliant idea, Mike! Can you imagine the chaos? I can already see Art's face when he finds out what we're up to.
:: Carmen : grinning : Count me in! The office has been feeling a bit lackluster lately. A little harmless fun never hurt anyone, right?

>> [2] > 2/2 - Mike, David
:: Mike : planning : Okay, so here's the deal. We'll split into teams and take turns infiltrating the dreams of our chosen coworkers. Just remember not to go too far, we don't want to cause any permanent damage.
:: David : enthusiastic : Oh, trust me, Mike. This is going to be epic! Like a real-life version of that movie, what was it called...? Oddception!

>> [3] > 3/3 - Rachel, Marcus, Carmen
:: Rachel : nervous : I don't know, guys. What if something goes wrong? Could we get in trouble for this?
:: Marcus : reassuring : Relax, Rachel. We'll be careful, and besides, it's all in good fun! Can't let the office get too serious, now can we?
:: Carmen : playful : Yeah, lighten up, Rachel. Just think of all the hilarious stories we'll have after this. We'll be legends!
