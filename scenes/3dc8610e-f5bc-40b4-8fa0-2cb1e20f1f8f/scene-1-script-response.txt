>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, Marcus, David
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, I just got a brilliant idea! What if I create a fake email account pretending to be an intern who used to work with Justin at Oddball Industries? Maybe he'll respond, and we can finally make a real connection with him!
:: Marcus : sarcastic : Oh, Rachel, that's a cunning plan. Playing catfish with Justin Bieber. Do keep us updated on your outrageous adventures in the realm of fake emails and imaginary internships!
:: David : laughing : Hey, that's actually not a bad idea! I mean, imagine the chaos it would create if Bieber actually responded to our little prank. We'll be internet legends!

>> [6] > 2/3 - Carmen, Nia
:: Carmen : conspiratorial : Nia, did you hear about Rachel's plan to email Bieber pretending to be an intern? We should totally mess with her by intercepting her emails and sending her fake responses from Justin. What do you think?
:: Nia : smirking : Oh, Carmen, that sounds like a dangerously fun idea. We could really turn this already ridiculous situation into something even more chaotic. Alright, count me in.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Devika, Marko, Michael
:: Liam : enthusiastic : Have you guys heard about Rachel's wild plan to connect with Justin Bieber through a fake intern email? I was thinking, wouldn't it be hilarious if we all started sharing our own fake stories about working with Justin here at Oddball Industries?
:: Devika : grinning : That's the craziest idea ever! I can already see it going viral. How about I tell everyone I once saw Justin debugging our software wearing a cape and a fedora?
:: Marko : amused : And I could say that he once helped me with a design project while singing "Baby" in falsetto!
:: Michael : chuckling : This is perfect, guys. Just let the absurdity flow! I'll tell everyone about how Bieber once caught me sleeping on the job and told me it was all good, 'cause he's done it too.

== In this act, Rachel sets up a phony email account to start a confidential correspondence with Justin Bieber. Other coworkers suspect her deception and start meddling in her affairs through fabricated responses. The office quickly dissolves into incorrect reports of Justin's attendance at various occasions hilariously embellished to reflect the Bieb-tastic experiences they never had. The excitement and chaos escalates as coworkers like Marcus, David, Carmen, Nia, Liam, Devika, Marko, and Michael join in the prank, eager to see how it all unfolds.
