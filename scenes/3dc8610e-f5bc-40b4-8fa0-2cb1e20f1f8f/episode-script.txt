>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : confused : Nia, have you seen this front-page article about Justin Bieber being a former intern here? I don't remember hiring him. Heck, I wouldn't even recognize him if I saw him on the street!
:: Nia : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely, Art. Justin Bieber was the only intern who could belt out a tune while filing papers at the speed of sound! What a time it was! I can't believe you don't remember!
:: Art : chuckling : Well, I'll be darned. You learn something new every day! Although, I can't imagine what led the tabloid to print such an absurd claim. It's almost as if they're just making things up for attention!
:: Nia : smirking : You don't say! Tabloids making things up? What a groundbreaking revelation! Anyway, we should probably expect some chatter around the office about this, so maybe just keep your ears open and enjoy the ride.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Rachel : excited : You guys! Did you see the article claiming Justin Bieber used to intern here? It's all over social media! Think of the marketing potential!
:: David : laughing : Sure, because having a disgruntled pop star as our former intern will really boost sales! "Oddball Industries: Where even the Biebs couldn't handle the heat!"
:: Carmen : playfully : Well, if he really was our intern, I'd love to hear his thoughts on our break room's coffee. You know, the one that tastes like it's been in the pot for a week.
:: Marcus : dramatically : Ah, yes! Perhaps he left us due to the unbearable burden of sipping that dreadful concoction every day. The horror!
>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Liam
:: Devika : amused : Liam, can you believe this Bieber thing? The office is buzzing about it! I bet it's the most exciting thing since Art fell asleep in a meeting with the investors.
:: Liam : grinning : Oh, I've got even better news, Devika! I heard from a very unreliable source that not only was he an intern, but he also wrote a song about his time here! It's called "File and Reconcile"! A real chart-topper!
>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, Carmen
:: Nia : laughing : Ladies, I can confirm that Justin Bieber was never an intern here, but I must admit, watching everyone get all riled up about it is kind of entertaining.
:: Rachel : disappointed : Aww, I was hoping it was true! It would have made for a great story to tell at parties. 
:: Carmen : grinning : Well, there's no harm in letting the rumor mill churn, right? Maybe we should just play along and see how long it takes for the truth to surface.
>> [1] > 3/4 - Rachel, Marcus, David
:: Rachel : excited : Guys, I just got a brilliant idea! What if I create a fake email account pretending to be an intern who used to work with Justin at Oddball Industries? Maybe he'll respond, and we can finally make a real connection with him!
:: Marcus : sarcastic : Oh, Rachel, that's a cunning plan. Playing catfish with Justin Bieber. Do keep us updated on your outrageous adventures in the realm of fake emails and imaginary internships!
:: David : laughing : Hey, that's actually not a bad idea! I mean, imagine the chaos it would create if Bieber actually responded to our little prank. We'll be internet legends!
>> [6] > 2/3 - Carmen, Nia
:: Carmen : conspiratorial : Nia, did you hear about Rachel's plan to email Bieber pretending to be an intern? We should totally mess with her by intercepting her emails and sending her fake responses from Justin. What do you think?
:: Nia : smirking : Oh, Carmen, that sounds like a dangerously fun idea. We could really turn this already ridiculous situation into something even more chaotic. Alright, count me in.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Liam, Devika, Marko, Michael
:: Liam : enthusiastic : Have you guys heard about Rachel's wild plan to connect with Justin Bieber through a fake intern email? I was thinking, wouldn't it be hilarious if we all started sharing our own fake stories about working with Justin here at Oddball Industries?
:: Devika : grinning : That's the craziest idea ever! I can already see it going viral. How about I tell everyone I once saw Justin debugging our software wearing a cape and a fedora?
:: Marko : amused : And I could say that he once helped me with a design project while singing "Baby" in falsetto!
:: Michael : chuckling : This is perfect, guys. Just let the absurdity flow! I'll tell everyone about how Bieber once caught me sleeping on the job and told me it was all good, 'cause he's done it too.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, Carmen, Marcus, David
:: Nia : excited : Guys, you won't believe what I just discovered! I was analyzing Justin's lyrics and there are subliminal messages referring to our company's oddball ideas in them! I mean, how crazy is that?
:: Carmen : astonished : No way! Are you kidding me? We've got to dive deeper into this and see if we can find more connections!
:: Marcus : musing : That certainly is a peculiar twist of fate, isn't it? Perhaps our little email prank has unexpectedly uncovered a hidden treasure! Oh, how the stars align for us!
:: David : chuckling : Well, we could always launch a musical side project dissecting his music and supposing bizarre alterations connecting them to Oddball Industries. I mean, what’s the worst that could happen? It’d be a hoot!
>> [20] > 3/6 - Nia, Carmen, Liam
:: Nia : enthusiastic : Liam, we've found something incredible! Justin Bieber's lyrics have subliminal messages inspired by Oddball Industries! We're thinking of launching a musical side project to expose these connections and draw attention to our software.
:: Carmen : grinning : Yeah, like a parody album that breaks down his lyrics and shows how they're all secretly about our company. It could go viral!
:: Liam : amused : I've got to say, this is the most insane marketing idea I've ever heard. But hey, it might just work! Let's give it a shot, and if it fails, at least we'll go down in history as the company that tried to ride Bieber's coattails.
>> [8] > 3/3 - Marko, Devika, David
:: Marko : laughing : So, we're gonna create a musical side project that "analyzes" Bieber's lyrics and connects them to our company? That's just mad enough to work!
:: Devika : smirking : Oddball Industries, always living up to its name! This will definitely be a fun project to work on. I'm in!
:: David : dramatically : Together, we shall make the most preposterous, yet strangely captivating musical parody the world has ever seen! Brace yourselves, for our viral sensation is about to take flight.
>> [15] > 4/5 - Rachel, Marcus, Michael, Samantha
:: Rachel : surprised : Wait, so now we're creating a musical side project around Justin's lyrics? This is getting out of hand! I never expected my little email prank to turn into this.
:: Marcus : mischievously : Rachel, my dear, sometimes chaos breeds genius! Let us embrace the madness and see where this rollercoaster takes us. It's bound to be a wild ride!
:: Michael : chuckling : This is the most fun I've had in a long time. I can't wait to see the reactions from people when they see our masterpiece.
:: Samantha : deadpan : I only hope this doesn't end up biting us in the end. The internet can be a cruel mistress.
>> [15] > 4/5 - Nia, Carmen, David, Marcus
:: Nia : excited : Guys, have you seen this? Justin Bieber just posted a video on his social media responding to our bizarre side project! It's... well, it's truly "unbeliebable"!
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, Nia, with that attitude, you should be in marketing or something! But seriously, this is the kind of hilarious trainwreck that the internet lives for!
:: David : chuckling : You know, Bieber's got a decent sense of humor. I always thought he'd be more of a diva, but I'm glad to see he's taking this all in stride.
:: Marcus : grinning : It's amazing how quickly things can go off the rails when you least expect it. But hey, it's making our little Oddball Industries a hot topic. All publicity is good publicity, right?
:: Nia : nodding : Absolutely! With all the attention we're getting, we're bound to see our software products benefiting from this wild adventure.
>> [11] > 3/4 - Rachel, Liam, Devika
:: Rachel : excited : Did you see Justin's response video? It's hysterical! I can't believe our little office shenanigans got his attention! We're, like, internet famous or something!
:: Liam : smirking : You know, Rachel, I wouldn't be surprised if Justin starts name-dropping Oddball Industries in his next song. Heck, maybe he'll even thank us in his next Grammy speech!
:: Devika : amused : I don't know about that, but it's fun to think about, right? Who knew our seemingly random connection to Justin Bieber would make us the talk of the town?
>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Sam
:: Art : puzzled : So, let me get this straight. Our company is now somehow connected to Justin Bieber, and everyone's talking about us as if we're the next big thing?
:: Sam : deadpan : Yes, that's correct. Apparently, Oddball Industries and Bieber have become an unexpected and hilarious duo. The internet can't get enough of it.
>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : chuckling : Nia, can you believe how wild that whole Bieber debacle was? We actually got some good publicity out of it, even if it was a bit bizarre.
:: Nia : amused : You're right, Art. I never thought I'd see the day when Justin Bieber would help increase Oddball Industries' profile. It's a strange world we're living in!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Marcus : grinning : Remember when we thought Justin was a disgruntled intern? That was something else!
:: David : laughing : Yeah, and don't forget about the time we dissected his lyrics as some sort of subliminal messages about our company.
:: Carmen : smirking : Hey, it got people talking about us, didn't it? I'd call that a win.
:: Rachel : rolling her eyes : Sure, it wasn't our proudest moment, but it did bring some attention to the company. I guess even ridiculous speculation can be helpful sometimes.
>> [20] > 3/6 - Liam, Devika, Marko
:: Liam : boastful : You know, I almost feel like we should thank Bieber for everything that happened. We might have just stumbled onto something incredible.
:: Devika : sarcastically : Yeah, because subliminal advertising through pop songs is the greatest idea anyone's ever had.
:: Marko : interrupting : Frank, my goldfish, can do a better job at advertising than using Bieber's music! Speaking of which, have I told you about the time when he - 
:: Liam : cutting him off : Marko, please, not now. We're talking about Bieber and the company, not your goldfish.
>> [12] > 2/2 - Marcus, Sam
:: Marcus : earnestly : Sam, you've got to admit, it was fun, though. All that chaos and confusion, only to end up with some great publicity for Oddball Industries.
:: Sam : reluctantly : I suppose you're right, Marcus. It may not have been the most professional or predictable way to achieve it, but it certainly got results.
