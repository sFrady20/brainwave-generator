:: Nia : excited : Guys, you won't believe what I just discovered! I was analyzing Justin's lyrics and there are subliminal messages referring to our company's oddball ideas in them! I mean, how crazy is that?
:: Carmen : astonished : No way! Are you kidding me? We've got to dive deeper into this and see if we can find more connections!
:: Marcus : musing : That certainly is a peculiar twist of fate, isn't it? Perhaps our little email prank has unexpectedly uncovered a hidden treasure! Oh, how the stars align for us!
:: David : chuckling : Well, we could always launch a musical side project dissecting his music and supposing bizarre alterations connecting them to Oddball Industries. I mean, what’s the worst that could happen? It’d be a hoot!

:: Nia : enthusiastic : Liam, we've found something incredible! Justin Bieber's lyrics have subliminal messages inspired by Oddball Industries! We're thinking of launching a musical side project to expose these connections and draw attention to our software.
:: Carmen : grinning : Yeah, like a parody album that breaks down his lyrics and shows how they're all secretly about our company. It could go viral!
:: Liam : amused : I've got to say, this is the most insane marketing idea I've ever heard. But hey, it might just work! Let's give it a shot, and if it fails, at least we'll go down in history as the company that tried to ride Bieber's coattails.
