title: The Unbeliebable Office Fiasco
exposition: A tabloid accidentally publishes a front-page article claiming that Justin Bieber is a disgruntled, yet surprisingly competent, former intern at Oddball Industries. As this fiction spreads wildly on social media, employees at the office have their own ideas and qualms about how their ordinary work week just became a bit unnerving celebrity chaos.

rising action: Rachel, in her defiant enthusiasm to connect with Justin, sets up a phony email account to start a confidential correspondence with him. Other coworkers suspect this deception and start meddling in her affairs through fabricated responses. The office quickly dissolves into incorrect reports of Justin's attendance at various occasions hilariously embellished to reflect the Bieb-tastic experiences they never had.

climax: Amidst exaggerated stories and false sightings, Nia Jones and Carmen suddenly realize that Justin has subliminal messages inspired by their company's oddball ideas hidden in his song lyrics. The office staff exploits this newfound intricacy to draw attention to their software products by launching a musical side project that dissects Justin's music and supposes bizarre alterations connecting them to Oddball Industries.

falling action: While the absurd side project gains in virality, Justin Bieber finally catches wind of these fictitious shenanigans and responds with a cheeky online video acknowledging his loose ties to the small company. With witty sarcasm and hints to possible future lyrics, the "unbeliebable" Oddball-Bieber amalgamation becomes one of the funniest trainwrecks internet culture bears witness to.

resolution: After the storm blows over, Oddball Industries determines their viral event has done more good than harm for business gains. The office encapsulates that time as an entertaining, awkward moment blending comedy, unpredictability, and of course, the strangeness one can expect from life at Oddball Industries. Reminiscing with a chuckle, employees occasionally bewilder each other with "remember the time when Bieber was - is - one of us?" stories.
