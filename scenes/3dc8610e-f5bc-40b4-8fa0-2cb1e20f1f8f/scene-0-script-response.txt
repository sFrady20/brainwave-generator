>> [19] > 2/3 - Art, Nia
:: Art : confused : Nia, have you seen this front-page article about Justin Bieber being a former intern here? I don't remember hiring him. Heck, I wouldn't even recognize him if I saw him on the street!
:: Nia : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely, Art. Justin Bieber was the only intern who could belt out a tune while filing papers at the speed of sound! What a time it was! I can't believe you don't remember!
:: Art : chuckling : Well, I'll be darned. You learn something new every day! Although, I can't imagine what led the tabloid to print such an absurd claim. It's almost as if they're just making things up for attention!
:: Nia : smirking : You don't say! Tabloids making things up? What a groundbreaking revelation! Anyway, we should probably expect some chatter around the office about this, so maybe just keep your ears open and enjoy the ride.

>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Carmen, Marcus
:: Rachel : excited : You guys! Did you see the article claiming Justin Bieber used to intern here? It's all over social media! Think of the marketing potential!
:: David : laughing : Sure, because having a disgruntled pop star as our former intern will really boost sales! "Oddball Industries: Where even the Biebs couldn't handle the heat!"
:: Carmen : playfully : Well, if he really was our intern, I'd love to hear his thoughts on our break room's coffee. You know, the one that tastes like it's been in the pot for a week.
:: Marcus : dramatically : Ah, yes! Perhaps he left us due to the unbearable burden of sipping that dreadful concoction every day. The horror!

>> [7] > 2/2 - Devika, Liam
:: Devika : amused : Liam, can you believe this Bieber thing? The office is buzzing about it! I bet it's the most exciting thing since Art fell asleep in a meeting with the investors.
:: Liam : grinning : Oh, I've got even better news, Devika! I heard from a very unreliable source that not only was he an intern, but he also wrote a song about his time here! It's called "File and Reconcile"! A real chart-topper!

>> [4] > 3/3 - Nia, Rachel, Carmen
:: Nia : laughing : Ladies, I can confirm that Justin Bieber was never an intern here, but I must admit, watching everyone get all riled up about it is kind of entertaining.
:: Rachel : disappointed : Aww, I was hoping it was true! It would have made for a great story to tell at parties. 
:: Carmen : grinning : Well, there's no harm in letting the rumor mill churn, right? Maybe we should just play along and see how long it takes for the truth to surface.
