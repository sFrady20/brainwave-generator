>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Liam
:: Nia : exasperated : Liam, have you heard about this toilet paper conspiracy Marcus has been going on and on about? It's bizarre and honestly, I'm not sure if he's joking or if he's really getting obsessed over this.
:: Liam : grinning : Nia, you never can tell with Marcus, right? I mean, if he's not starting a debate about the merits of pineapple on pizza, he's probably analyzing the origin of our coffee beans or something. It's all just harmless fun, I think.
:: Nia : sarcastic : Oh yes, harmless fun that's causing the entire office to erupt into a chaotic mess of conspiracy theories and gossip, making everyone think there's some hidden agenda behind the toilet paper issue. I've been trying to keep everyone on track, but it's getting increasingly difficult with each passing day.

>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Carmen, Rachel, Marcus
:: David : jocular : So, guys, I've got a new theory here. What if this whole toilet paper crisis is just a cover-up for something much bigger? Like, I don't know, maybe Art is secretly running a cat hoarding operation, and the lack of decent toilet paper is just to keep us distracted!
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, come on, David! That's just ridiculous! But, you know, I heard someone say the other day that the lower quality toilet paper is actually a cost-cutting measure because we're trying to fund a top-secret space program. Hey, maybe that's why we have so many rocket designs around the office.
:: Rachel : mock seriousness : This is getting out of control, guys. Instead of focusing on our jobs, we're all caught up in this toilet paper drama. But you know, if you ask me, it's probably something much simpler. Maybe Art just forgot to order the good stuff and is too embarrassed to admit it?
:: Marcus : smugly : My dear coworkers, do not fear. Our toilet paper investigation is in full swing, and I promise you, one way or another, I will uncover the truth. Our bathroom breaks shall be luxurious once again!
