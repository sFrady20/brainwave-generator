>> [2] > 2/2 - Marcus, David
:: Marcus : excited : David, have you noticed the recent decline in our toilet paper supplies? I mean, it's almost like we're being rationed here! We must unravel the mystery of the vanishing toilet paper, my friend.
:: David : amused : Haha, oh Marcus, you always come up with the craziest theories! But you know what, I did notice the toilet paper quality has gone down. It's like wiping with tree bark now. So, yeah, I'm in for a little office investigation.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, Nia, Liam, Carmen
:: Marcus : conspiratorial : Listen up, folks! We have a dire situation in our hands. Our once luxurious and bountiful toilet paper has been replaced with something barely fit for human use! I propose we form a secret coalition to get to the bottom of this... no pun intended. Who's with me?
:: Nia : sarcastic : Oh yes, Marcus, because the quality of our toilet paper is truly the most pressing issue we face today! But hey, who am I to argue? This place could use a little excitement, and if toilet paper mystery is the key, so be it.
:: Liam : smirking : Count me in, buddy! This is the kind of stuff that turns an ordinary workday into an extraordinary adventure! Plus, we can't have our bottoms being treated like second-class citizens, right?
:: Carmen : grinning : I'm all for it! Let's uncover the toilet paper conspiracy and restore our bathroom breaks to their former glory! This is the kind of crazy office drama I live for!
>> [18] > 3/3 - Marcus, David, Rachel
:: Marcus : animated : So, my fellow investigators, I've devised an intricate whiteboard diagram that lays out the intricacies of our toilet paper crisis. Observe as I detail the possible culprits, motives, and supply chain disruptions that have led to our current predicament.
:: David : chuckling : Marcus, your dedication to this cause is truly inspiring! Look at that whiteboard—it's like a mad scientist's manifesto! I can't help but admire your attention to detail, even if it is slightly unhinged.
:: Rachel : giggling : Oh, Marcus, you never cease to amaze me with your ability to turn any mundane situation into a thrilling adventure. I can't wait to see how this plays out. Honestly, I could use a little distraction from the office gossip!
>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Liam
:: Nia : exasperated : Liam, have you heard about this toilet paper conspiracy Marcus has been going on and on about? It's bizarre and honestly, I'm not sure if he's joking or if he's really getting obsessed over this.
:: Liam : grinning : Nia, you never can tell with Marcus, right? I mean, if he's not starting a debate about the merits of pineapple on pizza, he's probably analyzing the origin of our coffee beans or something. It's all just harmless fun, I think.
:: Nia : sarcastic : Oh yes, harmless fun that's causing the entire office to erupt into a chaotic mess of conspiracy theories and gossip, making everyone think there's some hidden agenda behind the toilet paper issue. I've been trying to keep everyone on track, but it's getting increasingly difficult with each passing day.
>> [11] > 4/4 - David, Carmen, Rachel, Marcus
:: David : jocular : So, guys, I've got a new theory here. What if this whole toilet paper crisis is just a cover-up for something much bigger? Like, I don't know, maybe Art is secretly running a cat hoarding operation, and the lack of decent toilet paper is just to keep us distracted!
:: Carmen : laughing : Oh, come on, David! That's just ridiculous! But, you know, I heard someone say the other day that the lower quality toilet paper is actually a cost-cutting measure because we're trying to fund a top-secret space program. Hey, maybe that's why we have so many rocket designs around the office.
:: Rachel : mock seriousness : This is getting out of control, guys. Instead of focusing on our jobs, we're all caught up in this toilet paper drama. But you know, if you ask me, it's probably something much simpler. Maybe Art just forgot to order the good stuff and is too embarrassed to admit it?
:: Marcus : smugly : My dear coworkers, do not fear. Our toilet paper investigation is in full swing, and I promise you, one way or another, I will uncover the truth. Our bathroom breaks shall be luxurious once again!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Marcus : manic : My friends, the time has come for us to band together and take a stand against this great toilet paper injustice! I've got a plan to address our concerns to Art, but we need unity and strength in numbers.
:: David : sarcastically : Ah yes, Marcus, nothing brings people together quite like a toilet paper crusade. Should we paint our faces and charge into battle? 
:: Carmen : giggling : I'll bring the pitchforks! And maybe a plunger, just in case.
:: Rachel : half-serious : In all seriousness, though, we could make some legitimate demands. Like, you know, decent quality toilet paper and an explanation for this whole mess.
>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Devika, Marko
:: Liam : dramatically : My fellow Oddballs, we must storm Art's office with our crazy theories and demands! Our very dignity is at stake!
:: Devika : amused : Oh, come on, Liam! It's just toilet paper. Besides, I heard a rumor that this all started because Nia has a secret cat hoarding operation going on.
:: Marko : laughing : Crikey! That's a wild theory, mate! I reckon we'll find a Mad Max style takeover in the office bathroom next!
>> [19] > 3/3 - Marcus, Rachel, Art
:: Marcus : determined : Art, we've come to demand answers and changes in our bathroom provisions! No more shall we suffer under poor toilet paper quality!
:: Rachel : supportive : Yeah, Art! We've got some, uh, interesting theories floating around and we need to get to the bottom of this. For the sake of everyone's sanity.
:: Art : sighing : Alright, you've got my attention. I'll look into the issue and ensure that we get better quality toilet paper. And for the record, there's no cat hoarding or Mad Max takeover happening here. I just... made some cost-cutting decisions. Clearly, I've underestimated the impact on morale.
>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Marcus, Liam
:: Art : scratching his head : Well, Marcus, Liam, I suppose I should own up to it. The reduction in toilet paper quality... it was me. I thought I could save the company a few bucks, but it's clear the staff cares deeply about their bathroom experience. So, I'll work on solving this issue, I promise.
:: Marcus : exaggeratedly disappointed : Oh, Art, this is truly a heart-wrenching revelation! My entire world has been turned upside-down, like a wobbly toilet paper roll that just won't stay put!
:: Liam : smirking : Honestly, I'm kind of impressed, Art. You managed to turn this office upside down over something as simple as toilet paper! Now we'll never be able to trust the softness of our behinds again.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : The lengths people will go to solve a toilet paper crisis! It's unbelievable that Art would make such a decision without considering the delicate bottoms of our colleagues.
:: David : chuckling : I can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of this entire situation! I mean, seriously, we've spent more time discussing toilet paper than actual work! It's like we've got our priorities all wrong.
:: Carmen : playfully mocking : Oh, David, don't you see? This is a conspiracy deeper than any of us could have imagined. It isn't just about toilet paper, it's about the fundamental rights of our hineys! This goes straight to the top!
:: Rachel : excited : Maybe we should protest in front of Art's office! We could even compose a catchy slogan like "Save Our Tushes, Art!" We can't let this injustice continue, even if it's just toilet paper we're fighting for!
>> [20] > 2/6 - Marcus, Devika
:: Marcus : dramatically : Devika! You wouldn't believe the staggering turns of events unfolding before our very eyes! Art has confessed to the toilet paper fiasco! The world as we know it will never be the same!
:: Devika : chuckling : Oh, Marcus, you're such a drama queen! But I have to admit, this whole thing has brought some much-needed entertainment to the office. It's not every day we get to uncover the truth behind a great toilet paper conspiracy!
>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Liam
:: Nia : sipping water : So, Liam, do you think the toilet paper crisis will blow up even more after Art's confession? You know, like a badly maintained bathroom stall?
:: Liam : grinning : Oh, for sure, Nia! This is just the beginning. I suspect there will be a never-ending cascade of revelations, each more ridiculous than the last. Our office will become a battleground for the finest-quality toilet paper!
>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Nia, Marcus
:: Rachel : excited : So, I heard a rumor that lizard people are responsible for the disappearance of our premium toilet paper. What do you all think about that? I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but considering the bizarre happenings in this office, I can't help but wonder.
:: David : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely, Rachel. It's definitely those pesky lizard people, always hoarding the good stuff for their scaly bottoms. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if they're shape-shifting into our coworkers just to infiltrate our ranks!
:: Nia : laughing : You know, David, that's the most ridiculous thing I've heard all day, and I absolutely love it. I thought the toilet paper crisis couldn't get any stranger, but here we are, discussing lizard people!
:: Marcus : animatedly : Well, since we're on the subject, I heard there's an unsanctioned seance going on later today. Apparently, some people in the office are trying to summon the Toilet Paper Gods to replenish our supplies. Maybe the lizard people will show up just to laugh at our pitiful attempts!
>> [5] > 3/3 - Carmen, Liam, Devika
:: Carmen : grinning : Hey guys, did you hear about the office-wide rock-paper-scissors tournament to decide who gets the last of the premium toilet paper? It's going to be intense!
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, I'm in it to win it! I've been training with a rock-paper-scissors master in the Himalayas, so there's no way I'm going to lose. Just kidding, but seriously, I've got my strategy all planned out.
:: Devika : amused : You two are cracking me up. But to be honest, I'm just enjoying the absurdity of this entire situation. I never thought I'd see the day when toilet paper became the center of office politics!
>> [18] > 3/3 - Rachel, Nia, Marcus
:: Rachel : contemplative : Maybe we should take a step back and think about what we're doing here. We've gone from lizard people to seances to rock-paper-scissors tournaments. I mean, it's hilarious, but it's also a little concerning, don't you think?
:: Nia : thoughtfully : You're right, Rachel. This whole thing has gotten out of hand, but at the same time, it's been a weirdly fun distraction from our day-to-day routines. 
:: Marcus : philosophizing : We've all been brought together by this strange toilet paper crisis, and it's opened our minds to the oddities of our office. We're bonding over strange theories and laughing at our own insanity, and maybe, just maybe... that's the point of all this chaos.
