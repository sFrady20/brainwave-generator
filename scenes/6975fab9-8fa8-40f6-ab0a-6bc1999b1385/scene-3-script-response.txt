>> [19] > 3/3 - Art, Marcus, Liam
:: Art : scratching his head : Well, Marcus, Liam, I suppose I should own up to it. The reduction in toilet paper quality... it was me. I thought I could save the company a few bucks, but it's clear the staff cares deeply about their bathroom experience. So, I'll work on solving this issue, I promise.
:: Marcus : exaggeratedly disappointed : Oh, Art, this is truly a heart-wrenching revelation! My entire world has been turned upside-down, like a wobbly toilet paper roll that just won't stay put!
:: Liam : smirking : Honestly, I'm kind of impressed, Art. You managed to turn this office upside down over something as simple as toilet paper! Now we'll never be able to trust the softness of our behinds again.
>> [11] > 4/4 - Nia, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Nia : rolling her eyes : The lengths people will go to solve a toilet paper crisis! It's unbelievable that Art would make such a decision without considering the delicate bottoms of our colleagues.
:: David : chuckling : I can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of this entire situation! I mean, seriously, we've spent more time discussing toilet paper than actual work! It's like we've got our priorities all wrong.
:: Carmen : playfully mocking : Oh, David, don't you see? This is a conspiracy deeper than any of us could have imagined. It isn't just about toilet paper, it's about the fundamental rights of our hineys! This goes straight to the top!
:: Rachel : excited : Maybe we should protest in front of Art's office! We could even compose a catchy slogan like "Save Our Tushes, Art!" We can't let this injustice continue, even if it's just toilet paper we're fighting for!

>> [20] > 2/6 - Marcus, Devika
:: Marcus : dramatically : Devika! You wouldn't believe the staggering turns of events unfolding before our very eyes! Art has confessed to the toilet paper fiasco! The world as we know it will never be the same!
:: Devika : chuckling : Oh, Marcus, you're such a drama queen! But I have to admit, this whole thing has brought some much-needed entertainment to the office. It's not every day we get to uncover the truth behind a great toilet paper conspiracy!

>> [2] > 2/2 - Nia, Liam
:: Nia : sipping water : So, Liam, do you think the toilet paper crisis will blow up even more after Art's confession? You know, like a badly maintained bathroom stall?
:: Liam : grinning : Oh, for sure, Nia! This is just the beginning. I suspect there will be a never-ending cascade of revelations, each more ridiculous than the last. Our office will become a battleground for the finest-quality toilet paper!

== The act follows the office's reaction to Art's revelation about the toilet paper crisis. While Marcus initially sulks, everyone collectively indulges in the absurdity of it all, with Carmen and Rachel even suggesting a full-blown protest. Devika finds the situation entertaining, and Liam and Nia predict an endless cascade of ridiculous revelations, turning the office into a battleground for premium toilet paper. All the while, the humor remains edgy and internet-inspired, with characters delivering clever quips, over-the-top reactions, and a healthy dose of irreverent banter.
