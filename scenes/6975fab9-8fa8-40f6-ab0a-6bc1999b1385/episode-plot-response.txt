title: The Great Toilet Paper Crisis
exposition: Marcus obsesses over a peculiar office mystery—the sudden, considerable drop in the quality and quantity of the office's toilet paper supplies. Instead of leading to personal stress, Marcus strives to uncover the ridiculous crisis, seeking solutions with cunning pranks and whiteboard diagrams.

rising action: The entire office staff's indolence begins skyrocketing as they bandwagon in mystifying suspicion. Absurd theories blur the line between reality and fiction; the water cooler becomes a gossip and comedy sesspool. Marcus orchestrates secretive meetings, in quirky makeshift offices or lunchrooms leading to many business miscommunications which propel chaos.

climax: Finally rallying up many unsuspecting permanent employees, Marcus coercively convenes a formidably unusual rogue strike at Art's office. Several odd demands surface, flying from flashy headlines blaming Nia for alleged cat hoarding to Mad Max style tribal takeovers.

falling action: Art finally confirms his personal involvement in systematically reducing supplies out of vaguely stated fiduciary reasons. Sulking down in graceful, jaded defeat, Marcus revisits previous stances—from pathological dark secrets to paranoid religious-social conspiracy theorizing. In a stupendously deafening, office rock-paper-scissors tournament, Marcus secures his path to a newly entrenched bathroom pot control policy.

resolution: In the chaotic aftermath of toilet paper urban legends, wildly exaggerated office hierarchy from claims of lizard people to unsanctioned seances divide and reintegrate rosters. The situation leaves everyone contemplating the fragility of their sociopolitical affiliations, colluding instead over outrageous trivia items learned only secondhand throughout the episode.
