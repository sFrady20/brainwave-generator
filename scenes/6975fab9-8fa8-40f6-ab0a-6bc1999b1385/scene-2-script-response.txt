>> [11] > 4/4 - Marcus, David, Carmen, Rachel
:: Marcus : manic : My friends, the time has come for us to band together and take a stand against this great toilet paper injustice! I've got a plan to address our concerns to Art, but we need unity and strength in numbers.
:: David : sarcastically : Ah yes, Marcus, nothing brings people together quite like a toilet paper crusade. Should we paint our faces and charge into battle? 
:: Carmen : giggling : I'll bring the pitchforks! And maybe a plunger, just in case.
:: Rachel : half-serious : In all seriousness, though, we could make some legitimate demands. Like, you know, decent quality toilet paper and an explanation for this whole mess.

>> [18] > 3/3 - Liam, Devika, Marko
:: Liam : dramatically : My fellow Oddballs, we must storm Art's office with our crazy theories and demands! Our very dignity is at stake!
:: Devika : amused : Oh, come on, Liam! It's just toilet paper. Besides, I heard a rumor that this all started because Nia has a secret cat hoarding operation going on.
:: Marko : laughing : Crikey! That's a wild theory, mate! I reckon we'll find a Mad Max style takeover in the office bathroom next!

>> [19] > 3/3 - Marcus, Rachel, Art
:: Marcus : determined : Art, we've come to demand answers and changes in our bathroom provisions! No more shall we suffer under poor toilet paper quality!
:: Rachel : supportive : Yeah, Art! We've got some, uh, interesting theories floating around and we need to get to the bottom of this. For the sake of everyone's sanity.
:: Art : sighing : Alright, you've got my attention. I'll look into the issue and ensure that we get better quality toilet paper. And for the record, there's no cat hoarding or Mad Max takeover happening here. I just... made some cost-cutting decisions. Clearly, I've underestimated the impact on morale.

== In this act, Marcus successfully rallies the employees, and they organize a rogue strike in Art's office to address the toilet paper crisis. Amidst the absurd theories and humor, they present their demands to Art. Art acknowledges the situation, promising to resolve it, and also clarifies that there's no cat hoarding or Mad Max takeover going on. Nonetheless, the ludicrous theories continue to spread and the act showcases the bizarre humor and eccentricities of the Oddball Industries staff.
