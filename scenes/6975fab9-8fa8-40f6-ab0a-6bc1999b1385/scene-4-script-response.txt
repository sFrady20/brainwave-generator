>> [11] > 4/4 - Rachel, David, Nia, Marcus
:: Rachel : excited : So, I heard a rumor that lizard people are responsible for the disappearance of our premium toilet paper. What do you all think about that? I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but considering the bizarre happenings in this office, I can't help but wonder.
:: David : sarcastically : Oh, absolutely, Rachel. It's definitely those pesky lizard people, always hoarding the good stuff for their scaly bottoms. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if they're shape-shifting into our coworkers just to infiltrate our ranks!
:: Nia : laughing : You know, David, that's the most ridiculous thing I've heard all day, and I absolutely love it. I thought the toilet paper crisis couldn't get any stranger, but here we are, discussing lizard people!
:: Marcus : animatedly : Well, since we're on the subject, I heard there's an unsanctioned seance going on later today. Apparently, some people in the office are trying to summon the Toilet Paper Gods to replenish our supplies. Maybe the lizard people will show up just to laugh at our pitiful attempts!

>> [5] > 3/3 - Carmen, Liam, Devika
:: Carmen : grinning : Hey guys, did you hear about the office-wide rock-paper-scissors tournament to decide who gets the last of the premium toilet paper? It's going to be intense!
:: Liam : smirking : Oh, I'm in it to win it! I've been training with a rock-paper-scissors master in the Himalayas, so there's no way I'm going to lose. Just kidding, but seriously, I've got my strategy all planned out.
:: Devika : amused : You two are cracking me up. But to be honest, I'm just enjoying the absurdity of this entire situation. I never thought I'd see the day when toilet paper became the center of office politics!

>> [18] > 3/3 - Rachel, Nia, Marcus
:: Rachel : contemplative : Maybe we should take a step back and think about what we're doing here. We've gone from lizard people to seances to rock-paper-scissors tournaments. I mean, it's hilarious, but it's also a little concerning, don't you think?
:: Nia : thoughtfully : You're right, Rachel. This whole thing has gotten out of hand, but at the same time, it's been a weirdly fun distraction from our day-to-day routines. 
:: Marcus : philosophizing : We've all been brought together by this strange toilet paper crisis, and it's opened our minds to the oddities of our office. We're bonding over strange theories and laughing at our own insanity, and maybe, just maybe... that's the point of all this chaos.

== In this act, the characters embrace the absurdity of the toilet paper crisis, discussing urban legends surrounding lizard people and unsanctioned seances, while Carmen brings up the rock-paper-scissors tournament. Devika finds the situation entertaining, but Rachel and Nia eventually realize that the chaos has brought them together in unexpected ways, allowing them to bond over trivia items learned from the bizarre events.
