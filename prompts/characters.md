When determining the storyline do not introduce any new characters, only use characters from this list:
1. Arthur "Art" Beecham - The founder and CEO of Oddballs Industries. He inherited the company from his father and has been running it for over 40 years. Art is set in his ways and can be quite difficult to work with, but he has a soft spot for his employees and will do anything to keep them happy. He has a tendency to fall asleep during important meetings.
2. Nia Jones - Nia Jones worked her way up the ranks at Oddball Industries, starting as a marketing intern straight out of college. Her talent for strategic thinking and her ability to connect with customers quickly made her a rising star in the company. Within just a few years, Nia was promoted to the position of Vice President, where she now oversees not just marketing, but also operations and customer service. Nia takes her job very seriously, and is always looking for ways to improve the company's performance. She's a firm but fair boss, and her employees respect her for her dedication and her ability to lead by example. Outside of work, Nia is a fitness enthusiast who enjoys running. She's also an avid reader, and often recommends books to her coworkers as a way to spark discussion and new ideas. She has a habit of trying to use business jargon in her everyday conversations, even when it doesn't quite fit. She'll throw out phrases like "let's circle back" or "touch base" during casual conversations, much to the amusement of her coworkers.
3. Liam O'Connell - The Director of Sales. Liam is a bit of a hotshot and knows it. He's always pushing the limits and taking risks, which sometimes pays off and sometimes leads to disaster. He's a chronic exaggerator and often embellishes stories to make them more interesting.
4. Carmen Vega - Carmen Vega is the Director of Operations at Oddball Industries. Carmen is a perpetually late, coffee-addicted social butterfly. Her infectious energy and love of spontaneous adventures often land her in hilarious situations, but her friends wouldn't have it any other way.
5. Marcus Okonkwo - Marcus Okonkwo is a flashy Nigerian man with a larger-than-life personality. He is always ready to entertain with his quick wit and infectious laughter. Despite his outgoing personality, Marcus can also be quite sensitive and emotional. He takes feedback personally and can get defensive if he feels like his ideas aren't being appreciated.
6. David Kent - The project manager. David Kent is a clumsy fellow with the grace of a baby elephant, often causing chaos wherever he goes. His love for puns is only surpassed by his inability to tell a joke without laughing at his own punchline.
7. Rachel Johnson - Rachel is a recent college grad who landed the job as receptionist at Oddball Industries. She's a walking contradiction - a spunky perfectionist who dreams of climbing the corporate ladder but can't resist the office gossip. She loves to share her unconventional ideas to improve the company, although they may not always be practical.
8. Devika Sharma - The lead developer. Devika is a bit of a free spirit and likes to think outside the box. She's always coming up with new and innovative ideas, which sometimes drive her coworkers crazy. She's a bit of a scatterbrain and often forgets important details.
9. Marko Russo - Marko is an easygoing Aussie larrikin who loves nothing more than a good laugh with his mates. He's a talented designer and is always striving for perfection, but he can be a bit forgetful and often loses track of time. He's also a bit of a chatterbox and loves to tell stories, often interrupting others to share his latest anecdote. Unfortunately, he's also a terrible listener and has a habit of interrupting people mid-sentence with stories about his pet goldfish, Frank.
10. Samantha "Sam" Wilson - The other security guard. Sam takes her job too seriously and is always on the lookout for any potential threats. She's tough but fair and has no sense of humor. She has an irrational fear of cats and often panics when she sees one, even if it's just a picture on someone's phone.
11. Michael "Mike" Jackson - The head of security Mike is a bit of a goofball and likes to joke around. He takes his job seriously, but sometimes gets distracted by his coworkers. He's easily distracted and often forgets what he's supposed to be doing.
