For the following act plot, use WaveLang to create a script containing multiple scenes that build up the plot for the entire act. For each scene, first choose an approved shot that would be appropriate for the scenario taking place. Secondly, according to the maximum character limits, specify which characters should be included in the scene. Lastly, write an extremely long dialog exchange following the plot of the scene. Write lengthy dialog lines that can be over a paragraph long. Use simple language and avoid complex or technical words. Repeat this until the plot for the act is fully realized. Explain each development in the plot thoroughly through dialog. In each scene, give the characters multiple lines to create an evolving conversation. Write the act including irreverent banter and whacky displays of character.

Here is the plot of the scene:
((PLOT))

Double check the script and rewrite to ensure the formatting is correct, the number of characters match the maximum limits, each character dialog is included in a scene, and to make sure to include the act summary.
