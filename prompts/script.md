For the following scene plot, create a script containing multiple sequences. For each sequence, choose an approved shot and specify which characters should be included in the scene then write an extremely long dialog exchange following the plot of the scene. Write lengthy dialog lines that can be over a paragraph long and write sequences that contain over ten dialog lines. Repeat this until the plot for the scene is fully realized. Explain each development in the plot thoroughly through dialog. Write the scene including irreverent banter and whacky displays of character.

Write each sequence in the following format:
```
[shot #]
character name: (inflection) message
... more lines of dialog
<transition #>
```

After the last sequence write a short summary of the events, conclusion, and any important information from created sequences to pass on to the next scene.
Mark the summary with ==summary==

Here is the plot of the scene:
