For the following scene plot, use the approved shots to build out a technical document detailing the sequences in the scene. For each sequence, first choose an approved shot and specify which characters should be included in the sequence. Then, write a long dialog exchange for the sequence following the plot of the scene. Repeat this until the scene has been fully realized. Use the minimal amount of shot changes and prefer lengthy dialog between one or two characters. Each dialog line should include witty irreverent humor that builds upon the character of the speaker.

Also after the last sequence write a short summary of the events, conclusion, and any important information from the scene to pass on to the next scene. Mark the summary with ==summary==

Write each sequence in the following format:
```
[shot #: description of shot]
dialog:
character name: (feeling of the actor) message
... repeat the previous line for the long dialog exchange
<transition #: description of transition to next sequence>
```

Here is the plot of the scene:
