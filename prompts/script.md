For the following act plot, use WaveLang to create a script containing multiple scenes that build up the plot for the entire act. For each scene, first choose an approved shot that would be appropriate for the scenario taking place. Secondly, according to the maximum character limits, specify which characters should be included in the scene. Lastly, write an engaging conversation between the characters in the scene, where each character contributes their own personality. Embellish the conversation with jokes and some off topic banter between the characters to make the conversation more enjoyable. Write lengthy dialog lines that can be over a paragraph long. Use simple language and avoid complex or technical words. Repeat this until the plot for the act is fully realized. Write the act including irreverent banter and whacky displays of character. Make the characters cartoonishly rediculous and add filler lines into the scenes that are only meant to make the characters seem more insane.

Here is the plot of the act:
((PLOT))

Double check the script and rewrite to ensure the formatting is correct, the number of characters match the maximum limits, and to make sure to include the act summary.
