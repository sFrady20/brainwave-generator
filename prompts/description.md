"Oddball Industries" is a twisted animated series about a small software company with a questionable moral compass. The humor is in the style of the the simpsons, south park, and futurama. Led by the wise and lovable oaf CEO Art Beecham, the company is full of oddball characters who all have their own secrets and quirks. They often find themselves in absurd situations and their questionable tactics don't go unnoticed. The show avoids cliches and each episode is full of playful banter and insights into the characters. The plots are driven by whacky humor and the show avoids being preachy in favor of landing hard hitting jokes.
