Using only these characters, create a plot based on a topic for an episode of an edgy, irreverent, comedy cartoon that takes place in the office environment. Center the plot around a main character who must navigate a non-business, non-technical, and unusual problem with humor and wit. Use the following topic as a starting point for creating the plot:
Marcus goes on vacation to tibet where he learns about meditation and miraculously immediately reaches enlightenment. Back at the office he tries to awaken his collegues but his ramblings seem to be incomprehensible to mortal beings. The more he tries to speak the less sense anything makes.

Favor making funny resolutions over teaching life lessons or anything that could come off as preachy. Weave in clippable, viral moments where the characters say something extremely odd and take the plot in wild directions. The story should only include the characters and shots mentioned in the prompt. Although the plot should be able to be played out within only shots from the prompt, the shots should not be explicitly stated. Start by giving the episode a title. The plot should have five story beats: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.

put the title and a paragraph for each story beat on their own line like so
```
title: ________
exposition: ________
rising action: _______
climax: _______
falling action: _______
resolution: ________
```
