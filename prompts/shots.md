When determining the storyline for the episode, only take in to account stories that can take place in one of these camera shots. Each camera shot should be treated as a separate location without the ability for characters to interact between different shots. The shots can only fit a set amount of characters, so write the story to have as many 1 on 1 conversations as possible. Keep in mind, the characters can not move around, sit or stand, or enter or exit the shot.
