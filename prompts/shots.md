When determining the storyline for the episode, only take in to account stories that can take place in one of these camera shots. When determining the characters for a scene, take in to account the maximum character limit for the shot and restrict adding more characters than the maximum characters indicated. Understand that characters can not interact between camera shots, so entire conversations should happen all in the same shot.
