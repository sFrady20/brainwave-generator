      and has been running it for over 40 years. Art is set in his ways and can be quite

      to keep them happy. He has a tendency to fall asleep during important meetings.

      and is always looking for ways to improve the company's performance. She's a firm but
      fair boss. Outside of work, Nia is a fitness enthusiast who enjoys running. She has a

    description: >-
      The project manager. David Kent is a clumsy fellow with the grace of a baby elephant,

      a chatterbox and loves to tell stories, often interrupting others to share his
